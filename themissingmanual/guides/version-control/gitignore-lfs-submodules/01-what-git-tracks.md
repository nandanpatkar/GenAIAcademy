# What Git tracks (and what "ignore" really means)

Here's the thing that trips almost everyone up at least once: you add a file to `.gitignore`, you commit, and the file *still shows up* in `git status`. You double-check the spelling. It's right. The pattern is right. And Git keeps tracking it anyway. You start to wonder if `.gitignore` is broken.

It isn't. You've hit the single most important fact about ignoring files, and it's the one nobody tells you up front. So let's get the mental model right before we touch a single pattern, because once this clicks, three different mysteries stop being mysteries.

## Git sorts every file into one of three buckets

At any moment, every file in your working directory is in exactly one of these states from Git's point of view:

```text
tracked     → Git knows about it, watches it for changes
untracked   → Git sees it but isn't watching it (shows in `git status`)
ignored     → Git is told to not even mention it
```

*What just happened:* Notice that **ignored** and **untracked** are different states, and - this is the key - `.gitignore` only ever affects **untracked** files. It tells Git "don't bother nagging me about this file you aren't tracking yet." It says *nothing* about files Git is *already tracking*.

That one sentence explains the mystery. If a file was committed before you ignored it, it's **tracked**. `.gitignore` doesn't apply to tracked files at all. Git keeps watching it, keeps showing its changes, keeps committing it - exactly as if the ignore rule weren't there.

> The fix, which we'll do properly in Phase 2, is to *untrack* the file (remove it from the index) so it falls back to being merely ignored. The ignore rule only gets a chance to work once the file is no longer tracked.

## The index: the part of Git people forget exists

To really get this, you need one more piece: the **index** (also called the *staging area*). It sits between your working directory and your commits.

```text
working directory  →  index (staging area)  →  commit history
   (your files)        (what's tracked,         (the snapshots
                        staged for next          you've saved)
                        commit)
```

*What just happened:* "Tracked" really means "present in the index." When you `git add` a file, you put it in the index. From then on Git follows it. `.gitignore` is a filter on what's *allowed into* the index on its own - it can't evict something that's already there. That's why ignoring a tracked file does nothing: the file is already past the gate.

So the rule in one line: **`.gitignore` keeps files OUT of the index; it cannot kick files OUT of it.** Kicking a file out is a separate, deliberate act (Phase 2).

## What belongs out of the repo

Before patterns, the *why*. Three kinds of things should almost never live in version control:

- **Generated output** - `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `target/`, compiled binaries, `__pycache__/`. These are reproducible from your source. Committing them bloats the repo and creates pointless merge conflicts. Anyone can regenerate them with one command.
- **Local and personal files** - editor settings, `.env` files, OS cruft like `.DS_Store`. These are about *your machine*, not the project.
- **Secrets** - API keys, passwords, tokens, private certificates. These should never enter history, and as Phase 3 will show, getting them *out* after the fact is genuinely hard.

```bash
# A starter .gitignore for a typical Node project
node_modules/
dist/
.env
.DS_Store
*.log
```

*What just happened:* Each line is a pattern. `node_modules/` ignores that whole folder; `*.log` ignores every file ending in `.log`; `.env` ignores that one file. Drop this in the repo root *before* your first commit and those files never get tracked in the first place - no untracking dance needed later. Prevention is far cheaper than cleanup.

## Big binaries are a different problem

Generated junk you keep out entirely. But sometimes you genuinely need a large file *in* the project - a design source, a sample dataset, a demo video. You can't ignore it; the project needs it. But Git was built for text, and it stores every version of every file forever.

```text
edit a 2GB video 5 times  →  Git stores ~10GB in history
                              (every version, full size, forever)
```

*What just happened:* Git diffs text beautifully but treats binaries as opaque blobs - every change stores a fresh full copy. A handful of edits to one big file can balloon your `.git` folder past the size of the actual project. Every clone then drags all of it down. This is the exact problem **Git LFS** (Large File Storage) exists to solve, and we'll set it up in Phase 2. The short version: LFS stores a tiny text *pointer* in your repo and stashes the real bytes elsewhere.

## For builders

When you scaffold a new project, the very first commit should already include a `.gitignore`. Most frameworks generate a sensible one for you (`create-react-app`, `cargo new`, `django-admin startproject` all do). GitHub also publishes a maintained collection at github.com/github/gitignore covering most languages - copy the one for your stack rather than hand-rolling it. Getting this right on commit one means you never fight a tracked-junk-file later.
