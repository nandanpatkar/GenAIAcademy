# A Prompt Is an Instruction, Not a Spell

If you've spent any time online, you've seen prompts shared like cheat codes — long strings of capital letters, "you are a world-class expert," "I will tip you $200," promises that *this exact wording* unlocks a smarter model. It's easy to come away believing the model has a hidden good mode, and your job is to find the password.

It doesn't, and that's good news. Once you understand the one thing a model is actually doing, you can reason about why a prompt works or fails — instead of collecting spells and hoping.

## What a language model actually does

**What it actually is.** A large language model (LLM) is a system that, given some text, predicts what text most plausibly comes next. You hand it a stretch of words; it produces the continuation that best fits everything it learned from a vast amount of human writing.

📝 **Terminology.** Your input — the text you give the model — is the **prompt**. The text it produces back is the **completion** or **output**.

**Why people get this wrong.** The chat interface makes it *feel* like you're talking to a person who understands you and is choosing to be helpful or lazy. So when the answer is bad, it's natural to think the model "didn't want to try," and that the right magic words will make it cooperate. But there's no will to coax. There's a continuation being predicted from your text. Change the text, and you change what's most likely to come next.

**A useful picture.**

  P[your prompt] --> M[the model<br/>predicts the most<br/>likely continuation] --> O[the output]
  V[vague, open-ended prompt] -.-> VG[vague, generic output]
  S[specific, framed prompt] -.-> SG[specific, on-target output]
```

The arrow is the whole job. A clearer, more specific, better-structured prompt narrows what a "good continuation" looks like — so the output lands closer to what you wanted.

## Vague in, vague out

The single biggest improvement most people can make is to stop being vague. A short, open-ended request gives the model almost nothing to aim at, so it produces the safest, most generic thing that technically answers you.

Watch the difference. Here's a vague prompt:

```text
Write something about dogs.
```

*What just happened:* You gave the model almost no constraints — no audience, no length, no purpose, no angle. The most likely continuation of "write something about dogs" is a bland, encyclopedia-flavored paragraph that could appear on any of a million pages. It's not the model being lazy; "generic" genuinely is the safest fit for a generic request.

Now the same intent, made specific:

```text
Write a 3-sentence intro for a blog post aimed at first-time dog owners,
explaining why crate training reduces a puppy's anxiety. Warm, practical tone.
```

*What just happened:* You pinned down the length (3 sentences), the audience (first-time owners), the exact topic (crate training and anxiety), the goal (a blog intro), and the tone (warm, practical). Now there's a narrow target, and the model's most-likely continuation is something genuinely usable. Same model, same "intelligence" — the gain came entirely from the instruction.

⚠️ **The trap to avoid.** When an answer disappoints, the instinct is to reach for a fancier phrase ("act as a senior copywriter," "be extremely detailed"). Reach for *specificity* first. Nine times out of ten, the answer was vague because the question was.

## Why this is the foundation

Everything in the next phase — giving context, specifying format, showing examples, asking for step-by-step reasoning — is the same move applied in different ways: **add information that narrows what a good continuation looks like.** None of it is a trick. It all flows from this one idea.

That's also why prompting is iterative, not a one-shot incantation. You write an instruction, see what continuation it produces, notice what was under-specified, and tighten it. You're not searching for a password. You're refining a brief.

## Recap

1. A language model predicts the most likely **continuation** of your text. That's the core of what it does.
2. The chat UI makes it feel like a person with moods, but there's no laziness to coax out — just a continuation predicted from your prompt.
3. **Vague in, vague out.** Open-ended requests get safe, generic answers because "generic" is the best fit for "generic."
4. Better prompting = adding information (specificity, context, format, examples) that **narrows the target**.
5. It's iteration, not incantation: write, observe, tighten.

With that model in place, the actual techniques stop looking like magic and start looking like common sense.
