# Prompt Engineering, Honestly

You've typed something into a chat box, gotten back a vague, generic answer, and wondered if there's a secret way to ask — some magic phrase the pros know that you don't. The internet is full of people selling exactly that feeling: "prompt hacks," "god-tier prompts," "the one trick that 10x'd my results."

Here's the honest version. There's no spell. A language model predicts the most likely continuation of the text you give it, so the quality of what you get back tracks the clarity of what you put in. That's the whole game — and it's a learnable, unglamorous skill, much closer to writing a good ticket for a coworker than to casting an incantation.

This guide gives you the mental model first, then the handful of techniques that genuinely move the needle, then an honest map of what prompting *can't* do — so you stop chasing magic words and start writing instructions that work.

## How to read this
- **Want the techniques fast?** Skim [Phase 2: The Techniques That Actually Help](02-techniques-that-help.md) — each one is a tiny annotated example.
- **Want it to finally make sense?** Read in order. Phase 1 installs the one idea that makes every technique in Phase 2 obvious.

## The phases
1. **[A Prompt Is an Instruction, Not a Spell](01-instruction-not-a-spell.md)** — the mental model: the model continues your text, so vague in means vague out.
2. **[The Techniques That Actually Help](02-techniques-that-help.md)** — context, roles, format, examples, step-by-step reasoning, and saying what *to* do — each with a small annotated prompt.
3. **[Honest Limits](03-honest-limits.md)** — what prompting can't fix (missing knowledge, guaranteed correctness), why "magic phrases" are mostly folklore, and the risks to watch when you mix in user input.

> Two big topics live in their own guides on purpose: feeding the model knowledge it doesn't have is covered in [RAG, Explained](/guides/rag-explained), and calling a model from your own code is covered in [Using an LLM API](/guides/using-an-llm-api).
