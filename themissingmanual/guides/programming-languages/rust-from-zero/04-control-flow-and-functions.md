# Control Flow & Functions

So far your programs run straight down, top to bottom. Real programs branch ("if it's hot, say so"),
repeat ("for each score, print it"), and split work into named, reusable pieces (functions). Along the way
you'll meet two ideas that make Rust feel different from most languages: **almost everything is an
expression that produces a value**, and **`match` forces you to handle every possible case.** That second
one is the star of the phase - the feature Rust programmers miss most when they go back to other languages.

## `if` / `else` - and it's an expression

You know `if`/`else`. The twist in Rust: an `if` doesn't just *do* something, it *produces a value*, so you
can assign its result directly to a variable.

```rust
fn main() {
    let temp = 30;
    let label = if temp > 25 { "hot" } else { "mild" };
    println!("{label}");
}
```
```console
$ cargo run
hot
```
*What just happened:* `if temp > 25 { "hot" } else { "mild" }` *evaluated* to one of the two strings and
`let label =` caught it. There's no ternary `? :` in Rust because plain `if` already does that job. (Both
branches must produce the *same* type.)

📝 **Terminology.** An **expression** produces a value (`2 + 2`, `if ... { } else { }`). A **statement**
does something but produces no usable value (`let x = 5;`). Rust leans hard on expressions - keep this
distinction in mind; it explains how functions return, below.

## The loops: `for`, `while`, `loop`

Rust has three ways to repeat, each for a different shape of problem.

**`for ... in`** - walking over a collection or a range. This is the one you'll use most:

```rust
fn main() {
    for n in [10, 20, 30] {
        println!("{n}");
    }
    for i in 0..3 {
        println!("i = {i}");
    }
}
```
```console
$ cargo run
10
20
30
i = 0
i = 1
i = 2
```
*What just happened:* The first loop walked the array. The second walked a **range**, `0..3`, meaning "0 up
to but not including 3" - so `0, 1, 2`. (To include the end, use `0..=3` for `0, 1, 2, 3`.)

**`while`** - repeats as long as a condition holds:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut count = 0;
    while count < 3 {
        println!("count {count}");
        count += 1;
    }
}
```
```console
$ cargo run
count 0
count 1
count 2
```
*What just happened:* The loop ran while `count < 3`, printing and incrementing each pass, then stopped
once `count` reached `3`. (Forgetting `mut` on `count` bites people here, as warned in
[Phase 2](02-syntax-values-and-types.md).)

**`loop`** - repeats forever until you `break` out. Useful when the exit condition is in the middle, not
the top:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut n = 1;
    loop {
        if n > 3 {
            break;
        }
        println!("n = {n}");
        n += 1;
    }
}
```
```console
$ cargo run
n = 1
n = 2
n = 3
```
*What just happened:* `loop` runs unconditionally; `break` is the only way out (here, once `n > 3`). Reach
for it when "keep going until something happens" reads more naturally than a `while` condition up top.

## `match` - the star: handle every case, exhaustively

**What it actually is.** `match` compares a value against a list of patterns and runs the first one that
fits. It's like a `switch` from other languages, but with a superpower: **it must cover every possible
case.** Forget one and the program *won't compile* - sounds strict, but it's one of Rust's best
bug-prevention features.

```rust
fn classify(n: i32) -> &'static str {
    match n {
        0 => "zero",
        1 | 2 | 3 => "small",
        4..=9 => "medium",
        _ => "large",
    }
}

fn main() {
    for n in [0, 2, 7, 100] {
        println!("{n} is {}", classify(n));
    }
}
```
```console
$ cargo run
0 is zero
2 is small
7 is medium
100 is large
```
*What just happened:* Each **arm** (`pattern => result`) is checked top to bottom; the first match wins.
`1 | 2 | 3` matches any of those values; `4..=9` matches the inclusive range 4 through 9; `_` is the
catch-all. Like `if`, `match` is an *expression*, which is why `classify` can hand the whole `match` back
as its answer.

Here's the flow of evaluating a single value through that `match`:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  V[value n] --> A{n == 0?}
  A -- yes --> R0["zero"]
  A -- no --> B{n is 1, 2, or 3?}
  B -- yes --> R1["small"]
  B -- no --> C{n in 4..=9?}
  C -- yes --> R2["medium"]
  C -- no --> R3["large (_)"]
```

### Why "exhaustive" is a gift, not a chore

Say you have a type with a fixed set of options (an `enum` - a value that's exactly one of several named
variants), and you forget to handle one:

```rust
enum Light { Red, Yellow, Green }

fn action(l: Light) -> &'static str {
    match l {
        Light::Red => "stop",
        Light::Green => "go",
        // forgot Yellow!
    }
}
```
```console
$ cargo run
error[E0004]: non-exhaustive patterns: `Light::Yellow` not covered
 --> src/main.rs:4:11
  |
4 |     match l {
  |           ^ pattern `Light::Yellow` not covered
  |
note: `Light` defined here
 --> src/main.rs:1:6
  |
1 | enum Light { Red, Yellow, Green }
  |      ^^^^^        ------ not covered
help: ensure that all possible cases are being handled by adding a match arm with a wildcard pattern or an explicit pattern as shown
```
*What just happened:* The compiler **refused to build** because `Light::Yellow` isn't handled. In most
languages this would compile fine and quietly do nothing for yellow lights, a bug you'd find in production.
Rust catches it at compile time and names exactly which case you missed.

💡 **Key point.** Exhaustive `match` means: add a new variant to an enum later, and the compiler walks you
to *every* `match` that now needs updating. "Handle all the cases" stops being something you remember - the
compiler remembers for you. Why refactoring Rust feels safe.

⚠️ **Gotcha - `_` can hide bugs.** The catch-all `_` *also* satisfies exhaustiveness. Perfect for
genuinely-infinite types like `i32` (as in `classify`), but on an enum it switches off the helpful "you
forgot a case" check. So on enums, prefer listing variants explicitly when you reasonably can - you *want*
the compiler to nag you when a new variant appears.

## Functions - and returning without `return`

**What it actually is.** A function is a named, reusable block of logic that takes inputs (parameters) and
optionally produces an output. Define one with `fn`, name the parameter types (always required), and name
the return type after `->`.

The Rust-flavored part: a function returns the value of its **last expression**, which has **no
semicolon.**

```rust
fn square(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x * x
}

fn main() {
    println!("square of 5 is {}", square(5));
}
```
```console
$ cargo run
square of 5 is 25
```
*What just happened:* `square` takes an `i32` named `x` and returns an `i32` (`-> i32`). Its body is the
single expression `x * x` - **no semicolon** - so that value *becomes the return value*. You don't need to
write `return x * x;`, though you can; `return` exists mainly for returning early mid-function.

⚠️ **The semicolon gotcha that bites everyone once.** A semicolon turns an expression into a statement,
which produces *no value*. Writing `x * x;` as the last line means the function returns "nothing" - and if
you promised an `i32`, the compiler stops you with a "mismatched types" error, expecting `i32` but finding
`()` (Rust's "no value," the *unit type*). The fix is almost always: **delete the trailing semicolon.**
Once "last line, no semicolon = the return value" clicks, this stops happening.

📝 **Terminology.** `()` is the **unit type** - Rust's way of saying "no meaningful value." A function with
no `-> Type` returns `()` (it's run for its side effects, like printing).

## Recap

1. **`if`/`else` is an expression** - it produces a value you can assign; there's no ternary because `if`
   covers it.
2. **`for ... in`** walks collections and ranges (`0..3` excludes the end; `0..=3` includes it); **`while`**
   loops on a condition; **`loop`** runs until `break`.
3. **`match` compares a value to patterns and is *exhaustive*** - forget a case and it won't compile. Like
   `if`, it's an expression that produces a value.
4. Exhaustiveness is a **gift**: add an enum variant and the compiler points you to every `match` to fix.
5. **Functions** use `fn`, require parameter types, and return after `->`. The **last expression with no
   semicolon** is the return value - a stray semicolon there is the classic beginner bug.

You can now branch, loop, and factor logic into functions. As programs grow past one file, you'll need a
way to organize them - that's next: modules, crates, and how a real Rust project is laid out. Right after
that comes the phase everything has been building toward: ownership.
