# Collections

A single value is rarely enough. You'll want a *list* of scores, a *table* of users by name, a *line* of
text built up piece by piece. This phase covers the containers you'll reach for every day, and tackles the
single most confusing thing for Rust newcomers head-on: why there are two kinds of string, `String` and
`&str`, and which to use when.

## `Vec<T>` - the growable list you'll actually use

**What it actually is.** A `Vec` (say "vector") is a list that can grow and shrink. `<T>` means "a Vec of
some type `T`" - `Vec<i32>` is a list of integers, `Vec<String>` a list of strings. Every element is the
same type. This is the workhorse collection; reach for it by default.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut scores = vec![10, 20, 30];
    scores.push(40);
    println!("{:?}", scores);
    println!("first: {}", scores[0]);
}
```
```console
$ cargo run
[10, 20, 30, 40]
first: 10
```
*What just happened:* `vec![10, 20, 30]` is a macro that builds a `Vec` with three starting values.
`scores.push(40)` added a fourth - why it's `mut`. `scores[0]` reads the first element (counting starts at
`0`). `{:?}` is a new placeholder: `{}` prints for *humans*, `{:?}` prints for *debugging* - handy for
whole collections, which have no "pretty" human form. (Most standard types support it.)

📝 **Terminology.** `{}` is **Display** formatting (clean, for users). `{:?}` is **Debug** formatting (for
you, the programmer). When Rust complains a type "doesn't implement `Display`," try `{:?}` instead.

## Iterating - `for ... in`

To do something with each element, loop over a *reference* to the collection with `for ... in`:

```rust
fn main() {
    let scores = vec![10, 20, 30, 40];
    for s in &scores {
        println!("score: {s}");
    }
}
```
```console
$ cargo run
score: 10
score: 20
score: 30
score: 40
```
*What just happened:* `for s in &scores` walked the list, binding each element to `s` in turn. `&` means
"borrow the list to read it, don't consume it," so `scores` is still usable afterward. (Why `&` matters is
the heart of [Phase 6: Ownership](06-ownership-and-borrowing.md); for now: loop over `&collection` when you
just want to read.)

## Arrays - fixed size, known up front

**What it actually is.** An array is like a `Vec`, but its length is fixed when you write it and never
changes. You'll use these less than `Vec`, but they show up for small, known-size groups of data.

```rust
fn main() {
    let days = [1, 2, 3];
    println!("{:?}", days);
}
```
```console
$ cargo run
[1, 2, 3]
```
*What just happened:* `[1, 2, 3]` is an array of exactly three integers - its size is part of its type
(`[i32; 3]`), and you can't `push` to it. **Rule of thumb:** use `Vec` if the count can change; an array
only when it's truly fixed and small. When in doubt, `Vec`.

## `String` vs `&str` - the confusion, finally cleared up

This is the one. Two types for text, and beginners can never remember which is which. Here's the mental
model that makes it stick:

- **`String` is an owned, growable buffer of text** - *you* own it, it lives on the heap, and you can
  modify and grow it. Think of it as a notebook you bought: yours, and you can keep writing in it.
- **`&str` (a "string slice") is a borrowed *view* into text someone else owns** - read-only, fixed. Think
  of it as a window looking at text: you can read what's there, but not change it through the window. A
  string literal like `"Ada"` is a `&str` (baked into your program - you're just viewing it).

📝 **Terminology.** **Owned** means "this value is responsible for its data and will clean it up."
**Borrowed** (the `&`) means "a temporary reference to data owned elsewhere." This split runs through all
of Rust - strings are just where you meet it first. [Phase 6](06-ownership-and-borrowing.md) makes it the
main event.

Here's both in one place:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut owned = String::from("Hello"); // owned, growable
    owned.push_str(", world");             // we can grow it
    println!("{owned}");

    let slice: &str = "literal";           // borrowed view, read-only
    println!("{slice}");
}
```
```console
$ cargo run
Hello, world
literal
```
*What just happened:* `String::from("Hello")` made an owned `String` we can extend - `push_str` appended
to it. `"literal"` is a `&str`, a fixed read-only view we can print but not grow. `owned` is a notebook;
`slice` is a window.

### Why two types? And the rule that ends the confusion

Rust splits them because they answer different questions. *Building* text - concatenating, reading user
input, assembling a message - needs ownership and growth, so use `String`. *Looking at* text - passing it
to a function that reads it, comparing it, printing it - doesn't need ownership, so `&str` is lighter and
more flexible.

That leads to the rule that solves 90% of the confusion in real code:

💡 **Key point.** **Take `&str` as a function parameter; return / store `String`.** A function that only
*reads* text should accept `&str`, because then it accepts *both* a borrowed slice and a borrow of an
owned `String` - the most flexible choice. Watch:

```rust
fn greet(name: &str) {        // accepts a view into any text
    println!("Hello, {name}!");
}

fn main() {
    let owned = String::from("Hello, world");
    greet("typed inline"); // a &str literal - works
    greet(&owned);         // &owned borrows the String *as* a &str - also works
}
```
```console
$ cargo run
Hello, world!
Hello, typed inline!
```
*What just happened:* `greet` asks for `&str`, and happily took both a literal *and* `&owned` (a borrow of
a `String`). That's the payoff: callers can hand you either kind of text. If `greet` demanded a `String`,
the literal call wouldn't compile and callers would be forced to allocate. So: **read with `&str`, own
with `String`.**

⚠️ **Gotcha.** You can't add a `&str` to a `String` with `+` the way you might guess from other languages,
and comparing a `String` to a `&str` needs care. Until ownership clicks, lean on the methods:
`my_string.push_str("more")` to append, `String::from("text")` to make one, and `&my_string` to pass it
where a `&str` is wanted. These cover almost everything early on.

## `HashMap` - look things up by key

**What it actually is.** A `HashMap<K, V>` stores **key → value** pairs and looks up a value by key fast -
the "dictionary" / "associative array" from other languages: an age by a person's name, a price by a
product code, a count by a word.

Unlike `Vec`, `HashMap` isn't in scope automatically - bring it in with a `use` line at the top of the file
(more on `use` in [Phase 5](05-modules-and-project-layout.md)):

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {
    let mut ages: HashMap<String, i32> = HashMap::new();
    ages.insert(String::from("Ada"), 36);
    ages.insert(String::from("Linus"), 54);

    match ages.get("Ada") {
        Some(age) => println!("Ada is {age}"),
        None => println!("Ada not found"),
    }
}
```
```console
$ cargo run
Ada is 36
```
*What just happened:* We created an empty map from `String` keys to `i32` values, inserted two pairs, then
looked one up. `ages.get("Ada")` doesn't return an age directly, but an `Option`: `Some(age)` if the key
exists, `None` if it doesn't. Rust makes you handle the "missing key" case right there with `match`, so you
can never accidentally use a value that wasn't found.

> ⏭️ `Option`, `Some`, `None`, and `match` are coming up properly: `match` in
> [Phase 4](04-control-flow-and-functions.md), and `Option`'s "no null in Rust" story in
> [Phase 7](07-errors-and-io.md). For now: `get` returns `Some(value)` or `None`, and you handle both.

⚠️ **Gotcha - HashMaps have no order.** Iterate a `HashMap` and the pairs come out in an unpredictable
order that can differ run to run - that's by design, and what makes lookups fast. Need a stable order?
Sort the keys yourself, or reach for `BTreeMap` (a sorted map) instead.

## Recap

1. **`Vec<T>`** is the growable list - your default container; `vec![...]` builds one, `.push()` grows it.
2. **`for x in &collection`** iterates by borrowing (so the collection survives the loop).
3. **Arrays** (`[1, 2, 3]`) are fixed-size; use `Vec` when the count can change.
4. **`String`** is owned and growable; **`&str`** is a borrowed, read-only view. **Read with `&str`, own
   with `String`.**
5. **`HashMap<K, V>`** stores key → value; `.get(key)` returns `Some(value)` or `None`, and it has no
   guaranteed order.
6. **`{}`** prints for humans (Display); **`{:?}`** prints for debugging (Debug) - use the latter for whole
   collections.

You can store data now. Next: make decisions about it and bundle logic into functions, where you'll meet
`match`, the feature Rust programmers love most.
