# The Streams API - Declarative Data Pipelines

In [Phase 11](11-lambdas-and-functional-interfaces.md) you learned a lambda is a chunk of behavior you can pass around - `n -> n.length() > 3` is a value, not just code. The Streams API is where lambdas earn their keep: hand those behaviors to a pipeline and say "run this over the whole collection for me."

The mental shift: a loop is **imperative** - spell out every mechanical step: counter, bound check, grab, test, append. A stream is **declarative**: describe *what* you want and let Java handle the *how*. Same idea as Python's generator expressions and Rust's iterator chains - stop hand-driving the loop, start describing the transformation.

## The mental model - a pipeline, not a loop

A **Stream** is not a collection - it stores nothing. It's a *pipeline* describing a sequence of operations to run over a source of data: transform these, keep those, add them up. You build the pipeline by chaining methods, then ask for a result.

📝 **Stream** - a one-pass pipeline over a sequence of elements. Describes operations (filter, map, aggregate) to apply, holds no data of its own, can't be reused once consumed.

The fastest way to feel the difference: write the same task both ways. Say we have a list of numbers and want the squares of just the even ones.

```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;

List<Integer> nums = List.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6);

// Imperative: spell out every mechanical step.
List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
for (int n : nums) {
    if (n % 2 == 0) {
        result.add(n * n);
    }
}
System.out.println(result);
```
```console
[4, 16, 36]
```
*What just happened:* this works, but most of it is *bookkeeping* - creating an empty list, loop scaffolding, manually appending. The intent ("keep evens, square them") is buried inside three lines of plumbing. Now as a stream:

```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

List<Integer> nums = List.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6);

List<Integer> result = nums.stream()
        .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)     // keep the evens
        .map(n -> n * n)             // square each one
        .collect(Collectors.toList());

System.out.println(result);
```
```console
[4, 16, 36]
```
*What just happened:* the intent is now the code. `filter` says "keep evens," `map` says "square them," `collect` says "gather into a list" - read top to bottom, it's almost an English sentence. No counter, no empty list to seed, no `.add()` to forget. That readability is the headline reason streams exist.

💡 **Key point.** A stream doesn't make a simple loop faster - for tiny tasks the loop may even be marginally quicker. The win is *clarity*: chained transformations read as a pipeline instead of a pile of mechanics. Reach for streams when filtering, mapping, and aggregating.

## Source → intermediate ops → terminal op

Every stream pipeline has the same three-part shape. Learn it and you can read any stream you'll meet.

📝 **The three parts.** **Source** - where elements come from (`list.stream()`, `Stream.of(...)`, `Arrays.stream(arr)`). **Intermediate operations** - `filter`, `map`, `sorted`, and friends; each returns *another stream* so they chain, and each is **lazy** (no work yet). **Terminal operation** - `collect`, `count`, `forEach`, `reduce`; returns a non-stream result and *triggers the whole pipeline to run*.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A["list.stream()<br/>SOURCE"] --> B["filter(...)<br/>intermediate (lazy)"]
  B --> C[".map(...)<br/>intermediate (lazy)"]
  C --> D["collect(...)<br/>TERMINAL - fires it all"]
```

The crucial, surprising part: **nothing runs until the terminal operation.** Intermediate ops just build up a description of work - the same laziness you saw in [Python's iterators](/guides/python-from-zero) and [Rust's iterator adapters](/guides/rust-from-zero): adapters describe, the consumer fires. Proof you can watch:

```java
import java.util.List;

List<String> names = List.of("ada", "bob", "cleo");

// No terminal operation - just intermediate ops.
names.stream()
     .filter(n -> {
         System.out.println("checking " + n);   // a side effect, to spy on it
         return n.length() == 3;
     });

System.out.println("--- pipeline built, but did it run? ---");
```
```console
--- pipeline built, but did it run? ---
```
*What just happened:* the `filter` body never printed a "checking" line - with no terminal operation, the pipeline was built and thrown away without running; the lambda was *never called*. Add a terminal op (`.count()`, `.collect(...)`, `.forEach(...)`) and the lines appear.

⚠️ **Gotcha - a stream with no terminal op does nothing.** The number-one stream surprise. If your filtering or mapping seems ignored, check that you ended with a terminal operation - a bare `list.stream().filter(...).map(...);` is a recipe nobody cooked. (Related trap: a stream is **single-use**. Once a terminal op consumes it, calling another operation on the same stream throws `IllegalStateException`. Build a fresh stream from the source each time.)

## Common operations - building the pipeline

The operations you'll reach for daily. Most are intermediate (return a stream); `reduce` and `collect` are terminal.

- **`filter(predicate)`** - keep only elements that pass the test.
- **`map(function)`** - transform each element into something else (often a different type).
- **`sorted()`** / **`sorted(comparator)`** - order the elements.
- **`distinct()`** - drop duplicates (uses `equals`).
- **`limit(n)`** - keep at most the first `n` elements, then stop.
- **`reduce(...)`** - collapse the whole stream into a single value (sum, product, concatenation).

A realistic chain: raw names, keep only the "adult" ones (length standing in for some real condition), uppercase, sort, collect as a list.

```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

List<String> raw = List.of("bob", "ada", "cleo", "al", "bob");

List<String> cleaned = raw.stream()
        .filter(name -> name.length() >= 3)   // drop the too-short "al"
        .distinct()                           // collapse the duplicate "bob"
        .map(String::toUpperCase)             // shout each name
        .sorted()                             // alphabetical order
        .collect(Collectors.toList());

System.out.println(cleaned);
```
```console
[ADA, BOB, CLEO]
```
*What just happened:* read the chain as a sentence. `filter` removed `"al"` (too short); `distinct` collapsed the two `"bob"`s into one; `map` uppercased each survivor (`String::toUpperCase` is a method reference from Phase 11); `sorted` alphabetized them; `collect` gathered the result into a `List`. Five clear steps, each line exactly one transformation.

`reduce`, the terminal op that folds a stream down to one value:

```java
import java.util.List;

List<Integer> prices = List.of(10, 25, 5, 40);

int total = prices.stream()
        .reduce(0, (running, price) -> running + price);   // start at 0, keep adding

System.out.println("total: " + total);
```
```console
total: 55
```
*What just happened:* `reduce` takes a starting value (`0`) and a function combining the running result with the next element: `0+10`, `10+25`, `35+5`, `40+40`, arriving at `55` - the general shape of "boil a sequence down to one answer." For common cases (sum, average, count) reach for a purpose-built collector or `IntStream.sum()` instead; `reduce` is the engine underneath them all.

## Collectors - reshaping a stream into a result

A stream produces a sequence; eventually you want it back as something storable - a `List`, `Map`, count, or joined string. That's the job of **collectors**, used with the `collect(...)` terminal op.

💡 **Key point.** Think of `Collectors` as the toolbox for the *last* step: "I have a stream of elements - reshape them into a List, a Map, or a summary."

The everyday collectors:

```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

List<String> words = List.of("apple", "banana", "cherry");

List<String> asList = words.stream()
        .map(String::toUpperCase)
        .collect(Collectors.toList());                 // -> a List

String joined = words.stream()
        .collect(Collectors.joining(", ", "[", "]"));  // glue with separators

System.out.println(asList);
System.out.println(joined);
```
```console
[APPLE, BANANA, CHERRY]
[apple, banana, cherry]
```
*What just happened:* `Collectors.toList()` gathered the mapped elements into a `List`. `Collectors.joining(", ", "[", "]")` stitched the strings together with a separator, prefix, and suffix - cleaner than building a `StringBuilder` by hand. (Modern Java also offers `.toList()` directly on the stream as a shortcut.)

Now the one that changes how you think: **`groupingBy`**. It takes a function producing a *key* for each element and hands back a `Map` where each key points to the list of elements sharing it - the streaming equivalent of SQL's "GROUP BY."

```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

record Person(String name, String city) {}

List<Person> people = List.of(
        new Person("Ada", "London"),
        new Person("Bob", "Paris"),
        new Person("Cleo", "London"),
        new Person("Dan", "Paris")
);

Map<String, List<Person>> byCity = people.stream()
        .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Person::city));

System.out.println(byCity.get("London"));
```
```console
[Person[name=Ada, city=London], Person[name=Cleo, city=London]]
```
*What just happened:* `groupingBy(Person::city)` called `.city()` on each person for a key and bucketed everyone into a `Map<String, List<Person>>` keyed by city - Ada and Cleo in `"London"`, Bob and Dan in `"Paris"`. By hand this means a map, a loop, `computeIfAbsent`, and appending - a dozen lines collapsed into one. Nest a *second* collector to summarize each group:

```java
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

// ...same `people` list as above...

Map<String, Long> countByCity = people.stream()
        .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Person::city, Collectors.counting()));

System.out.println(countByCity);
```
```console
{Paris=2, London=2}
```
*What just happened:* the second argument, `Collectors.counting()`, tells `groupingBy` not to collect the people themselves but to *count* them per group - `{Paris=2, London=2}`. Other downstream collectors work the same way: `Collectors.toMap` builds a key→value map directly, `Collectors.mapping(...)` transforms group members before collecting. One collector can feed another.

## Parallel streams & when to use streams

This looks like free speed and is mostly a trap if used carelessly. Swap `.stream()` for `.parallelStream()` (or call `.parallel()` on an existing stream) and Java splits the work across multiple CPU cores using the common fork/join pool.

```java
import java.util.stream.IntStream;

long count = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 1_000_000)
        .parallel()
        .filter(n -> n % 7 == 0)
        .count();

System.out.println(count);
```
```console
142857
```
*What just happened:* filtering a million numbers got chopped into chunks, run on several cores at once, then combined - a genuine speedup on a multi-core machine for big, CPU-bound, independent computations.

⚠️ **Parallel is not free, and can make things slower or wrong.** **(1)** Splitting, scheduling, and merging have overhead - for small collections or cheap per-element work, parallel is *slower* than plain `.stream()`; it only pays off for large data with real per-element cost. **(2)** Side effects in parallel are dangerous: a lambda mutating a shared `ArrayList` or counter from multiple threads is a data race waiting to corrupt results or throw - keep stream operations *pure*. **(3)** Order-dependent operations get more expensive or behave differently. Measure before you parallelize.

💡 **When should you use streams at all?** Reach for one when expressing a *transformation* - filter, map, group, aggregate - since the pipeline reads cleanly. Stick with a plain `for` loop when the logic is simple, when you need an early `break` streams make awkward, when mutating external state, or when a stream would genuinely be *harder* to read. A clear loop beats a contorted stream - don't force it.

## Recap

1. A **Stream** is a declarative pipeline over a sequence - you describe *what* to do (filter, map, aggregate), not the loop mechanics. Stores no data, single-use.
2. Every pipeline is **source → intermediate ops → terminal op**. Intermediate ops (`filter`, `map`, `sorted`, `distinct`, `limit`) are **lazy** and chainable; the terminal op (`collect`, `count`, `forEach`, `reduce`) fires the whole thing.
3. ⚠️ **Nothing runs without a terminal operation** - the most common stream mistake.
4. **Collectors** reshape a stream into a result: `toList`, `joining`, `toMap`, and especially **`groupingBy`** (with downstream collectors like `counting`) for bucketing elements into a `Map`.
5. **`parallelStream()`** splits work across cores - only helps for large, CPU-bound, side-effect-free work. Measure first; pure operations only.
6. Use streams for readable transformations; a plain loop is fine for simple cases. Don't force it.

You can now read and write the pipeline style that dominates modern Java codebases. Next: **records and sealed types** - the features that make the immutable, intent-revealing data classes from the idioms phase a single line of code.
