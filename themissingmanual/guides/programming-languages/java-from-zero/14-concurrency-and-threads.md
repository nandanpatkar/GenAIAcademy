# Concurrency & Threads - Doing Many Things at Once, Safely

Every program you've written so far has done one thing at a time: line runs, finishes, next line runs. Concurrency breaks that: you ask the machine to run several paths of execution *simultaneously*, so a server can handle a thousand requests at once, or an app can download a file without freezing the UI.

The honest framing: **starting threads is easy; sharing data without corrupting it is the hard part.** A thread alone is tame. Two threads touching the same variable with no coordination is where careers' worth of subtle, intermittent, impossible-to-reproduce bugs come from. We'll make threads, learn the danger they create, then spend most of our time on the tools that tame it.

The arc: raw `Thread`s (the bricks), race conditions (the disease), `synchronized` and the memory model (the cure), `java.util.concurrent` (the tools to actually reach for), and virtual threads (the modern leap that makes blocking code scale).

## Threads - an independent path of execution

📝 **A thread is an independent path of execution within your program.** Your program already has one - the "main" thread running `main()`. A new thread is a second worker running its own code at the same time, sharing the first's memory. The OS juggles them across CPU cores (and, when threads outnumber cores, by rapidly switching between them).

You create one by giving it work: a `Runnable` - an object with a single `run()` method - written cleanest as a lambda ([Phase 11](11-lambdas-and-functional-interfaces.md)):

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Thread worker = new Thread(() -> {
            System.out.println("worker thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        });

        worker.start();          // spawns a NEW thread, runs the lambda there
        System.out.println("main thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());

        worker.join();           // wait for the worker to finish before exiting
    }
}
```
```console
$ java Main.java
main thread: main
worker thread: Thread-0
```
*What just happened:* `new Thread(() -> ...)` wrapped your lambda as the thread's job but did *not* run it yet. `worker.start()` asked the OS for a new thread and ran the lambda there, concurrently with `main`. The two `println`s race - `main` printed first here, but the order can flip next run, since nobody coordinated them. `worker.join()` blocks main until the worker finishes, so the program doesn't exit out from under it.

⚠️ **The bug that bites everyone once: calling `run()` instead of `start()`.** They look interchangeable. They aren't.

```java
Thread worker = new Thread(() -> {
    System.out.println("on: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
});

worker.run();    // WRONG - runs the lambda on the CURRENT thread, no new thread at all
worker.start();  // RIGHT - spawns a new thread
```
```console
$ java Main.java
on: main
on: Thread-0
```
*What just happened:* `run()` is a normal method call - it executes the lambda on whatever thread called it (`main`). No concurrency happens. Only `start()` asks the OS for a fresh thread. If "concurrent" code mysteriously runs perfectly in order, single-file, check whether someone called `run()` - the silent no-op of Java threading.

## The danger - shared mutable state & race conditions

The moment two threads read *and* write the same data, you have a potential **race condition** - the central villain of all concurrency.

📝 **A race condition is a bug where the correctness of your program depends on the unpredictable timing of threads.** The result changes depending on which thread gets there first - the program might work a million times and fail on the million-and-first, depending on how the OS scheduled things that instant.

The classic demonstration: two threads incrementing the same counter. You'd expect 200,000; you won't get it.

```java
public class Main {
    static int counter = 0;   // shared, mutable - the danger zone

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Runnable job = () -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 100_000; i++) {
                counter++;          // looks atomic. is not.
            }
        };

        Thread t1 = new Thread(job);
        Thread t2 = new Thread(job);
        t1.start();
        t2.start();
        t1.join();
        t2.join();

        System.out.println("expected 200000, got: " + counter);
    }
}
```
```console
$ java Main.java
expected 200000, got: 143281
```
*What just happened:* `counter++` looks like one step, but it's three: **read**, **add** one, **write** back. Two threads can both read `5`, both compute `6`, both write `6` - two increments, one gain. That lost update, repeated tens of thousands of times, is why we landed at `143281` instead of `200000`. ⚠️ Run it yourself and you'll get a *different* wrong number each time - that non-determinism is what makes race conditions so maddening to track down.

Threads are cheap. *Sharing mutable state correctly* is the expensive, careful work, and everything below exists to make it safe.

## `synchronized` & the memory model

The fix is **mutual exclusion**: guarantee only one thread at a time can run the read-add-write sequence. Java's built-in tool is the `synchronized` keyword.

📝 **`synchronized` marks a block (or method) as a critical section guarded by a lock.** Every Java object has an invisible lock (a "monitor"). A thread entering a `synchronized` block must acquire that lock; if another holds it, the newcomer waits. Only one thread runs the protected code at a time, so the read-add-write can't be interrupted halfway.

```java
public class Main {
    static int counter = 0;
    static final Object lock = new Object();   // the thing we lock on

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Runnable job = () -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 100_000; i++) {
                synchronized (lock) {           // one thread at a time, in here
                    counter++;
                }
            }
        };

        Thread t1 = new Thread(job);
        Thread t2 = new Thread(job);
        t1.start(); t2.start();
        t1.join();  t2.join();

        System.out.println("expected 200000, got: " + counter);
    }
}
```
```console
$ java Main.java
expected 200000, got: 200000
```
*What just happened:* Each thread had to grab `lock` before touching `counter`, so the read-add-write sequence ran start-to-finish without the other sneaking in - every one of the 200,000 increments landed. The trade-off is real: threads now take turns through that block instead of running in parallel, so heavily-contended locks cost speed. The art is locking the *smallest* section that keeps you correct.

💡 **The memory model, in one paragraph.** A second, sneakier danger beyond lost updates: **visibility**. The JVM and CPU can cache variables in registers and reorder instructions for speed, so a write one thread makes to a shared variable might *never become visible* to another - it could spin forever reading a stale cached value. The **Java Memory Model (JMM)** defines when one thread's writes are guaranteed visible to another, via **happens-before**: releasing a lock happens-before another thread acquiring that same lock, so everything written inside a `synchronized` block is visible to the next thread entering it. That's why `synchronized` fixes *both* atomicity and visibility at once.

📝 **`volatile` handles visibility alone.** Marking a field `volatile` guarantees every read sees the most recent write from any thread - no stale caches, no reordering past it. But it does **not** give atomicity: a `volatile` counter still loses updates under `counter++`, since read-add-write is still three steps. ⚠️ Rule of thumb: `volatile` for a simple flag one thread sets and another reads (like `boolean running`); `synchronized` (or atomics below) the moment a thread needs to *read-then-write* shared state.

## Higher-level concurrency - prefer it

The most important practical advice in this phase: **most of the time, you should not be writing `new Thread(...)` or `synchronized` by hand at all.** Hand-managing threads is error-prone and wasteful - every `new Thread` is a real OS thread costing memory and startup time, and writing your own locking is how the subtle bugs above creep in. `java.util.concurrent` gives you battle-tested tools that handle all of it.

💡 **The default move: reach for `java.util.concurrent` first.** An `ExecutorService` for running tasks, `AtomicInteger` for lock-free counters, `ConcurrentHashMap` for shared maps - written and tested by experts. Your hand-rolled version will be slower and buggier.

**Thread pools via `ExecutorService`.** Instead of a thread per task (exhausting the machine at a million tasks), a **thread pool** keeps a fixed crew of reusable threads pulling tasks from a queue. You submit work; the pool decides which thread runs it.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  S[submit tasks] --> Q[task queue]
  Q --> T1[pool thread 1]
  Q --> T2[pool thread 2]
  Q --> T3[pool thread 3]
  T1 --> R[results]
  T2 --> R
  T3 --> R
```

**`Callable` and `Future`.** A `Runnable` returns nothing; a `Callable<T>` returns a value. Since the result isn't ready immediately, `submit` hands you a `Future<T>`, an IOU you cash in later with `.get()` (which blocks until the answer is ready).

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        ExecutorService pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

        Future<Integer> future = pool.submit(() -> {
            Thread.sleep(100);          // pretend this is slow work
            return 6 * 7;
        });

        System.out.println("doing other work while it computes...");
        Integer answer = future.get();   // blocks here until the result is ready
        System.out.println("the answer: " + answer);

        pool.shutdown();                 // stop accepting tasks; let running ones finish
    }
}
```
```console
$ java Main.java
doing other work while it computes...
the answer: 42
```
*What just happened:* `Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3)` made a pool of three reusable threads. `pool.submit(callable)` queued the work and immediately returned a `Future` - main kept going and printed its message *before* the result existed. `future.get()` then blocked until the pool thread finished and handed back `42`. ⚠️ Always `shutdown()` a pool when done; its threads are non-daemon by default and will keep the JVM alive otherwise.

**`CompletableFuture` for composing async work.** `Future.get()` is blocking and clumsy when chaining steps ("fetch data, *then* transform it, *then* save it"). `CompletableFuture` describes that pipeline declaratively and runs it without blocking:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CompletableFuture<String> pipeline =
            CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "data")        // step 1, on a background thread
                .thenApply(s -> s.toUpperCase())               // step 2, when step 1 finishes
                .thenApply(s -> "[" + s + "]");                // step 3, when step 2 finishes

        System.out.println(pipeline.join());                   // wait for the whole chain
    }
}
```
```console
$ java Main.java
[DATA]
```
*What just happened:* `supplyAsync` ran the first step on a background thread and returned a `CompletableFuture` immediately. `thenApply` attached the next step to run *automatically* when the previous one completed - no manual `get()`, no blocking between stages; the runtime wired up the handoffs. Modern Java composes async work this way: stages connected by `thenApply`, `thenCompose`, `thenCombine`, each firing when its input is ready.

💡 **Lock-free counters with `AtomicInteger`.** Remember the broken counter? `AtomicInteger` solves it without any lock you write: `count.incrementAndGet()` is a single atomic operation, implemented with a CPU compare-and-swap instruction - simpler and faster than `synchronized` for a shared counter. Same spirit: `ConcurrentHashMap` for a map many threads hammer at once. Reach for these before raw locks.

## Virtual threads - the modern leap

📝 **Virtual threads (Project Loom, standard since JDK 21) are extremely lightweight threads managed by the JVM rather than the OS.** A traditional ("platform") thread maps one-to-one onto a heavy OS thread - realistically a few thousand before memory runs out. A virtual thread is a cheap Java object; the JVM parks it off its underlying OS thread whenever it blocks (on I/O, a sleep, a lock) and reuses that OS thread elsewhere. You can run **millions** of them.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        try (ExecutorService pool = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()) {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1_000_000; i++) {
                pool.submit(() -> {
                    Thread.sleep(1000);   // a blocking call - fine here
                    return null;
                });
            }
        } // try-with-resources waits for all tasks to finish
        System.out.println("ran a million blocking tasks");
    }
}
```
```console
$ java Main.java
ran a million blocking tasks
```
*What just happened:* `newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()` gave every one of a million tasks its *own* virtual thread - something that would instantly exhaust memory with platform threads. Each task blocked on `Thread.sleep`, but a blocked virtual thread costs almost nothing: the JVM unmounted it from its OS thread, freeing that thread to serve others.

**Why this matters for servers.** The old way to scale to many connections was reactive/async code - non-blocking callbacks, fast but genuinely hard to read and debug. Virtual threads let you write plain, straight-line **blocking** code ("read the request, query the DB, write the response") that scales to enormous concurrency anyway, because blocking is now cheap. Simple code, huge throughput.

⚠️ **Virtual threads do not repeal the laws of concurrency.** They're cheaper threads, not safer ones. Every race condition, every visibility bug, every **deadlock** - two threads each holding a lock the other needs, both stuck forever - is just as possible with a million virtual threads as with two platform threads. The new tools change the *cost* of concurrency, never the *correctness rules*. Shared mutable state still needs `synchronized`, atomics, or `java.util.concurrent` - that hard part never goes away, it just gets better tools.

## Recap

1. **A thread is an independent path of execution.** Wrap work in a `Runnable`/lambda and call **`start()`** (not `run()` - `run()` executes on the current thread and spawns nothing).
2. **A race condition** is a bug whose result depends on thread timing. `counter++` is read-add-write, not atomic, so concurrent increments lose updates - the heart of why concurrency is hard.
3. **`synchronized`** gives mutual exclusion (one thread at a time) *and*, via the **Java Memory Model's happens-before** rules, visibility. **`volatile`** gives visibility only - good for a flag, useless for read-then-write.
4. **Prefer `java.util.concurrent`.** An **`ExecutorService`** thread pool instead of raw threads, `Callable`/`Future` for results, **`CompletableFuture`** for async pipelines, and `AtomicInteger`/`ConcurrentHashMap` instead of hand-rolled locks.
5. **Virtual threads** (JDK 21+) are JVM-managed, near-free threads that let simple blocking code scale to millions - but ⚠️ they don't make races or **deadlocks** go away. Better tools, same rules.

You can now make programs do many things at once *and* keep their shared data intact - the skill that separates code that works on your laptop from code that survives production. Next: under the hood of the machine running all this - how the JVM manages memory, garbage collection, and just-in-time compilation.
