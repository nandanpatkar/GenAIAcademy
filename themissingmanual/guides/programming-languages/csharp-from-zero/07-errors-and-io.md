# Errors & I/O - Exceptions, Resources & Files

Up to now your programs have run the happy path: the file was there, the number parsed, the index was in range. Real programs spend half their lives off it - disks fill, users type nonsense, networks blink. This phase covers how C# tells you when something went wrong, and how you respond without leaving a mess behind.

If you've read the [Go guide](/guides/go-from-zero), you saw a language where *errors are values* - a function returns a failure alongside its result, checked on the spot. C# made the opposite bet: failure is a **thrown object** that interrupts normal flow and travels *up* the call stack looking for someone willing to handle it. That's the **exception**, and getting comfortable with it - when to catch, when to throw, how to always clean up - is the whole job.

## Exceptions - C#'s error model

**What it actually is.** An exception is an object (an instance of `Exception` or a subclass) *thrown* when something goes wrong. The instant it's thrown, the current method stops dead and the runtime starts **unwinding the stack** - abandoning the current method, then its caller, then *its* caller - until it finds a `catch` block willing to handle it. If nobody catches it, the program crashes and prints a **stack trace** showing the path the exception took.

📝 **Exception** - an object describing a failure, thrown at the point of trouble and caught (or not) up the call chain. **`try`** wraps risky code; **`catch`** handles a failure; **`finally`** runs cleanup either way. **Stack trace** - the printed list of method calls the exception unwound through, newest first.

⚠️ **C# exceptions are all *unchecked*.** Unlike Java's "checked exceptions," the compiler never makes you wrap a call in `try`/`catch`. Any method can throw anything, and you'll only find out at runtime or by reading its docs - freedom and a footgun in one.

The mental model: a thrown exception is a hot potato, rising until someone catches it or it falls out the top and crashes the program.

**A real example.**

```csharp
int[] scores = { 90, 80, 70 };

Console.WriteLine("about to read index 5");
Console.WriteLine(scores[5]);   // there is no index 5
Console.WriteLine("this line never runs");
```
```console
$ dotnet run
about to read index 5
Unhandled exception. System.IndexOutOfRangeException: Index was outside the bounds of the array.
   at Program.<Main>$(String[] args) in /app/Program.cs:line 5
```
*What just happened:* `scores[5]` reached past the end of a three-element array, so the runtime threw an `IndexOutOfRangeException`. The third `WriteLine` never ran - the throw aborted the method immediately. With no `catch` anywhere up the stack, the program printed "Unhandled exception," the type and message, and the stack trace pointing at `line 5` - your best clue for *where* a crash happened.

Now wrap it so the failure is handled instead of fatal:

```csharp
int[] scores = { 90, 80, 70 };

try
{
    Console.WriteLine(scores[5]);
}
catch (IndexOutOfRangeException ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"oops: {ex.Message}");
}
finally
{
    Console.WriteLine("cleanup always runs");
}

Console.WriteLine("program continues normally");
```
```console
$ dotnet run
oops: Index was outside the bounds of the array.
cleanup always runs
program continues normally
```
*What just happened:* the `try` block threw, and control jumped straight to the matching `catch`, which read `Message` and kept going. `finally` ran next - it runs whether the `try` succeeded, threw and was caught, or threw something *not* caught here. Execution flowed past the whole block and the program continued. The exception was contained.

## Catching well - be specific, don't swallow

**What it actually is.** A `catch` block can name the exception type it handles. Stack several, and the runtime picks the *first* matching type. The art is catching failures you can actually do something about, and letting everything else keep rising.

💡 **Catch specific types, not `Exception`.** A bare `catch (Exception ex)` grabs *everything*: the file-not-found you expected, but also out-of-memory, a null-reference bug, a typo you'd want to crash loudly. Swallowing it all hides real bugs behind a calm-looking but quietly broken program. Catch the narrowest type you're prepared to handle; if you can't recover, don't catch - let it propagate (or crash, which is honest).

**A real example.**

```csharp
string input = "not a number";

try
{
    int n = int.Parse(input);
    Console.WriteLine($"parsed {n}");
}
catch (FormatException ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"bad input, not a number: {ex.Message}");
}
catch (OverflowException)
{
    Console.WriteLine("that number is too big to fit in an int");
}
```
```console
$ dotnet run
bad input, not a number: The input string 'not a number' was not in a correct format.
```
*What just happened:* `int.Parse` throws a `FormatException` when the text isn't a number and an `OverflowException` when it's too large for `int`. We wrote a separate `catch` for each, and the runtime matched `FormatException` and skipped the other. We did *not* write `catch (Exception)` - an unrelated bug should crash and show us, not get mistaken for "bad input."

**Exception filters with `when`.** Sometimes you want to catch a type only *when* a condition holds - retry on some HTTP failures but not others. `when` adds that condition without forcing you to catch, inspect, and re-throw.

```csharp
try
{
    throw new InvalidOperationException("retryable: server busy");
}
catch (InvalidOperationException ex) when (ex.Message.Contains("retryable"))
{
    Console.WriteLine("caught a retryable error, will try again");
}
```
```console
$ dotnet run
caught a retryable error, will try again
```
*What just happened:* the `when (...)` filter ran *before* the catch body engaged. The message contained "retryable," so the filter returned `true` and this block handled it. Had it *not* matched, this `catch` would have been skipped entirely and the exception kept unwinding, as if the block weren't there. That's the win over catching-then-rethrowing: a declined exception never counts as "handled here," keeping a cleaner stack trace.

## Throwing & custom exceptions

**What it actually is.** You raise an exception yourself with `throw new SomeException("message")`, when your method is asked to do something it *can't* sensibly do. Built-in types cover most cases: `ArgumentException` (a parameter is wrong), `ArgumentNullException` (a required argument was null), `InvalidOperationException` (wrong state for this call).

**A real example - validate and throw.**

```csharp
decimal Withdraw(decimal balance, decimal amount)
{
    if (amount <= 0)
        throw new ArgumentException("amount must be positive", nameof(amount));
    if (amount > balance)
        throw new InvalidOperationException("insufficient funds");

    return balance - amount;
}

Console.WriteLine(Withdraw(100m, 30m));   // fine
Console.WriteLine(Withdraw(100m, 500m));  // throws
```
```console
$ dotnet run
70
Unhandled exception. System.InvalidOperationException: insufficient funds
   at Program.<Withdraw>g__Withdraw|0_0(Decimal balance, Decimal amount)
```
*What just happened:* the first call passed validation and returned `70`. The second asked to withdraw more than the balance - a state this method refuses to handle - so it threw `InvalidOperationException`. `throw` immediately stopped `Withdraw` and handed the failure to the caller. `nameof(amount)` passes the parameter's name to the exception so the message can say *which* argument was bad, without hard-coding a string that would rot if you renamed the parameter.

**A small custom exception.** When the built-ins don't capture your domain, derive your own from `Exception` - convention names it `...Exception` with a constructor that takes a message.

```csharp
public class InsufficientFundsException : Exception
{
    public decimal Shortfall { get; }

    public InsufficientFundsException(decimal shortfall)
        : base($"short by {shortfall:C}")
    {
        Shortfall = shortfall;
    }
}

decimal Withdraw(decimal balance, decimal amount)
{
    if (amount > balance)
        throw new InsufficientFundsException(amount - balance);
    return balance - amount;
}

try
{
    Withdraw(100m, 130m);
}
catch (InsufficientFundsException ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"declined - {ex.Message} (shortfall {ex.Shortfall})");
}
```
```console
$ dotnet run
declined - short by $30.00 (shortfall 30)
```
*What just happened:* `InsufficientFundsException` carries a typed `Shortfall` field, so callers can catch it specifically *and* read structured data off it - far better than parsing a string message. `: base(...)` hands a human-readable message up to `Exception`. A caller can write `catch (InsufficientFundsException ex)` to handle exactly this case.

💡 **Throw vs. return a result.** Throw for the *exceptional* - the genuinely unexpected, "I can't do my job" case. For normal, expected outcomes (a lookup that might miss, a parse that might fail on user input), prefer a non-throwing path: `int.TryParse` and `dictionary.TryGetValue` return a `bool` instead, because "the user typed letters" is a Tuesday, not a catastrophe. Exceptions are relatively expensive and interrupt flow.

## `using` / `IDisposable` - deterministic cleanup

**What it actually is.** Some objects hold resources the garbage collector can't tidy up promptly - open files, sockets, database connections. These must be *released* the moment you're done, not "eventually." C#'s answer is **`IDisposable`**: any type holding such a resource implements a `Dispose()` method that releases it. **`using`** guarantees `Dispose()` runs the instant the variable leaves scope - even if an exception is thrown partway through.

📝 **`IDisposable`** - an interface with one method, `Dispose()`, for releasing unmanaged resources. **`using`** - calls `Dispose()` automatically when its scope ends: "open this, and *no matter what happens*, close it on the way out."

**Why this exists.** You *could* do this by hand with `try`/`finally` - open the file, `Close()` in a `finally` block so it runs even on failure. `using` is that pattern compressed into one keyword you can't forget.

**A real example.**

```csharp
using (var writer = new StreamWriter("log.txt"))
{
    writer.WriteLine("first line");
    writer.WriteLine("second line");
}   // writer.Dispose() runs HERE - file flushed and closed automatically

Console.WriteLine("file is closed and saved");
```
*What just happened:* `StreamWriter` implements `IDisposable` because it holds an open file handle. The `using` block opened the file, wrote to it, and called `writer.Dispose()` automatically at the closing brace, flushing buffered text to disk and releasing the handle. Even if `WriteLine` had thrown, `Dispose()` would *still* run, so the file would never stay locked open.

Modern C# offers a tidier form, the **`using` declaration** - no braces, disposal at the end of the *enclosing* scope:

```csharp
void SaveReport()
{
    using var writer = new StreamWriter("report.txt");
    writer.WriteLine("totals: ...");
    // no closing brace block - writer.Dispose() runs when SaveReport() returns
}
```
*What just happened:* `using var writer = ...` is the same guarantee with less nesting - `Dispose()` fires when `writer` falls out of scope at the method's end. Use this form when the resource lives the whole method; use braced `using (...) { }` to release it partway through instead.

## File I/O - reading and writing

**What it actually is.** `System.IO` is C#'s toolbox for files and streams. For "read/write a whole file," the static `File` class has one-call helpers; for a large file piece by piece, `StreamReader` streams it line by line without loading it all into memory.

**A real example - the one-call helpers.**

```csharp
using System.IO;

File.WriteAllText("greeting.txt", "hello\nfrom C#");

string whole = File.ReadAllText("greeting.txt");
Console.WriteLine($"--- whole file ---\n{whole}");

string[] lines = File.ReadAllLines("greeting.txt");
Console.WriteLine($"--- line count: {lines.Length} ---");
foreach (string line in lines)
    Console.WriteLine($"> {line}");
```
```console
$ dotnet run
--- whole file ---
hello
from C#
--- line count: 2 ---
> hello
> from C#
```
*What just happened:* `File.WriteAllText` created (or overwrote) the file and wrote the string in one call - opens, writes, closes for you, no handle to dispose. `File.ReadAllText` slurped the entire contents as one string; `File.ReadAllLines` split on line breaks into a `string[]`. Perfect for small files. ⚠️ The catch is in the name: `ReadAllText` loads the *whole* file into memory, so a multi-gigabyte log needs streaming instead.

**Reading line by line with `StreamReader`.** For a big file, read it as a stream so only one line sits in memory at a time, wrapped in `using` so the handle always closes.

```csharp
using System.IO;

File.WriteAllLines("data.txt", new[] { "alpha", "beta", "gamma" });

using var reader = new StreamReader("data.txt");
string? line;
int count = 0;
while ((line = reader.ReadLine()) != null)
{
    count++;
    Console.WriteLine($"{count}: {line}");
}
```
```console
$ dotnet run
1: alpha
2: beta
3: gamma
```
*What just happened:* `StreamReader.ReadLine()` returns the next line each call, and `null` when nothing's left - the loop's exit condition. Only one line is held at a time, working on files far too large for RAM. `using var` releases the handle when the method ends, even if a read throws. `string? line` marks it possibly-null, since `ReadLine()` returns `null` at end of file (more in [Phase 13](13-records-and-modern-csharp.md)).

⚠️ **`NullReferenceException` - the error you'll hit most.** Calling a method or reading a property on a `null` reference throws `NullReferenceException` ("Object reference not set to an instance of an object") - C#'s single most common runtime crash, from a file read returning `null`, a missed dictionary lookup, an object you forgot to construct. The modern defense is **nullable reference types**, warning the compiler about possible nulls *before* you run - covered in [Phase 13](13-records-and-modern-csharp.md) and [Phase 9](09-idioms-and-gotchas.md). For now: check before you use a value that *could* be null.

## Recap

1. **Exceptions are C#'s error model** - a thrown object aborts the current method and unwinds the stack until a `catch` handles it; uncaught, it crashes with a stack trace. `try`/`catch`/`finally` is the structure, and `finally` always runs.
2. **All C# exceptions are unchecked** - the compiler never forces you to handle one, so knowing what can throw is on you. Catch *specific* types you can recover from; never swallow a bare `catch (Exception)` and hide real bugs. Use `when` filters to catch conditionally.
3. **Throw deliberately** - `throw new ArgumentException(...)` when your method can't do its job; define a custom `: Exception` to carry typed, domain-specific data. Reserve exceptions for the genuinely exceptional; prefer `TryParse`-style methods for expected failures.
4. **`using` / `IDisposable` guarantee cleanup** - `using var f = ...;` calls `Dispose()` at scope end no matter what, so files, connections, and sockets are always released. It's `try`/`finally` for resources, made unforgettable.
5. **File I/O lives in `System.IO`** - `File.ReadAllText`/`WriteAllText`/`ReadAllLines` for whole small files; `StreamReader.ReadLine()` in a `using` for large files read line by line.
6. ⚠️ **`NullReferenceException` is the crash you'll meet most** - calling into a `null` reference. Check for null, and lean on nullable reference types ([Phase 13](13-records-and-modern-csharp.md)) to catch it at compile time.

You can now fail gracefully and clean up after yourself - the difference between a toy and a program people trust. Next we step out of the language and into the toolbox around it: how real C# projects are structured, how to pull in libraries with NuGet, and the commands that build and run it all.
