# Modules, tsconfig & the Build - Configuring the Compiler

For seven phases you've been writing types and pretending the compiler reads them somehow. This phase names
that "somehow" and turns a folder of `.ts` files into a *real project*: code split across files that import
each other, a config file that tells the compiler how to check and build, and an answer to "wait, who
actually turns my `.ts` into `.js`?"

Here's the mental model to hold onto: **TypeScript is a checker bolted onto a compiler, and `tsconfig.json`
is the dial board for both.** Every option either changes *how strictly it checks* or *what JavaScript it
emits*. Seen through that lens, the file stops looking like an intimidating wall of JSON and starts looking
like a short list of decisions you actually understand.

## Modules in TypeScript - same import/export you already know

TypeScript doesn't invent its own module system - it uses **ES modules**, the exact `import` / `export`
syntax from JavaScript. If you've worked through the [JavaScript guide](/guides/javascript-from-zero), this
is the same `import { thing } from "./file"` you already know.

What *is* new: both **values** and **types** travel through those same statements. You export a function (a
value) the same way you export an `interface` (a type).

```typescript
// money.ts
export interface Money {
  amount: number;
  currency: string;
}

export function format(m: Money): string {
  return `${m.amount.toFixed(2)} ${m.currency}`;
}

// checkout.ts
import { Money, format } from "./money";

const total: Money = { amount: 19.99, currency: "USD" };
console.log(format(total));
```

`Money` is a type - exists only at check-time, vanishes from the output. `format` is a value - real runtime
code. `checkout.ts` imports both with one `import` line, and TypeScript sorts out which is which: `Money`
type-checks `total`, while `format` becomes a genuine function call in the emitted JavaScript.

### `import type` - saying "this is types only"

Sometimes you import *only* a type from another file - no functions, no runtime values. Mark that intent
explicitly with **`import type`**; it's worth the habit.

```typescript
// checkout.ts
import type { Money } from "./money";
import { format } from "./money";

const total: Money = { amount: 19.99, currency: "USD" };
console.log(format(total));
```

`import type { Money }` tells the compiler "I need this name only for type-checking - it has no runtime
existence." When TypeScript emits JavaScript, that line is **erased completely**. A plain `import { Money }`
might leave behind an `import "./money"` statement that a bundler then has to resolve and possibly include,
even though `Money` is just a shape.

💡 **Why bother with `import type`.** It does two jobs: guarantees the import is dropped from the build, so
you never accidentally pull a whole module into your bundle just to reference one interface; and documents
intent, sidestepping a class of circular-dependency headaches. Prefer it for type-only imports.

## `tsconfig.json` - the control panel

The compiler checks your types and emits JavaScript. One file decides what to check and what to emit.

📝 **`tsconfig.json`** - a JSON file at the root of your project that tells `tsc` how to behave: which files
to include, how strictly to type-check them, and what kind of JavaScript to produce. Run `tsc` in a folder
containing this file and it reads it automatically - no flags needed. Your editor reads it too, which is why
VS Code's red underlines match what the command line reports.

A sensible starter config - the kind you'd happily drop into a new project today:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2022",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "Bundler",
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "lib": ["ES2022", "DOM"],
    "strict": true,
    "sourceMap": true,
    "declaration": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"]
}
```

Everything lives under `compilerOptions`, plus an `include` array saying "compile every file under `src/`."
Each option is one decision about checking or emitting - don't memorize the list, the next two sections cover
the ones that earn their place. This file is the entire contract between you and the compiler; change a
value here and the behavior of `tsc` (and your editor) changes everywhere.

## The options that actually matter

You can ignore most of `tsconfig`'s long option list for a long time. The handful you'll set on day one, one
sentence of *why* each:

- **`target`** - which version of JavaScript to emit. Newer (`ES2022`) means cleaner output assuming a
  modern runtime; older (`ES5`) adds compatibility shims for ancient browsers. Pick the oldest environment
  you must support.
- **`module`** - the module *format* of the emitted code (`ESNext` for `import`/`export`, `CommonJS` for
  Node's older `require`). Decides how your `import` lines look after compilation.
- **`outDir`** / **`rootDir`** - where compiled `.js` files go (`outDir`) and where your source `.ts` lives
  (`rootDir`). Keeping output in `dist/` and source in `src/` stops generated files cluttering your code.
- **`lib`** - which built-in type definitions are available. Add `"DOM"` and the compiler knows about
  `document` and `window`; omit it for a pure Node project so browser globals don't sneak in.
- **`sourceMap`** - emit `.map` files so debuggers and stack traces point back to your original TypeScript
  instead of the compiled JavaScript. Turn it on; future-you debugging production will be grateful.
- **`declaration`** - emit `.d.ts` files alongside the JavaScript, letting *other* TypeScript projects
  consume your code with full types - essential for a published library, ignorable for a leaf app.

⚠️ **`target` is about *output*, not what you can write.** Setting `target: "ES2022"` doesn't unlock new
syntax for you - you can already write any modern TypeScript. It controls what the *emitted JavaScript* looks
like and which runtime features it assumes exist. Too new and your code may use syntax an old browser chokes
on; too old and `tsc` bloats the output down-leveling features nobody needed.

## `strict` mode - turn it on, always

Of every option above, one matters more than all the others combined. If you remember a single line from
this phase, make it `"strict": true`.

📝 **`strict`** - a master switch that turns on a bundle of the compiler's strongest safety checks at once,
including **`strictNullChecks`** (treat `null` and `undefined` as their own types you must handle, not
silent members of every type) and **`noImplicitAny`** (refuse to silently give a value the escape-hatch `any`
type when it can't infer one). It's the difference between TypeScript that *catches bugs* and TypeScript that
mostly nods along.

The most valuable thing in that bundle is `strictNullChecks`. Without it, `null` and `undefined` quietly
belong to *every* type, so the compiler waves through code that will explode at runtime:

```typescript
// With strictNullChecks OFF (strict: false), this compiles cleanly:
function firstChar(name: string): string {
  return name[0].toUpperCase();
}

const users: { name?: string } = {};
firstChar(users.name); // name is undefined - boom at runtime, no compiler warning
```

`users.name` is optional, so it's `undefined` here. With strict mode off, the compiler treats `undefined` as
an acceptable `string` and lets you pass it to `firstChar`. At runtime, `undefined[0]` throws `Cannot read
properties of undefined` - the exact bug TypeScript is supposed to prevent, sailing straight through because
the safety net was off.

Now turn `strict: true` on:

```typescript
// With strictNullChecks ON, the same call is a compile error:
function firstChar(name: string): string {
  return name[0].toUpperCase();
}

const users: { name?: string } = {};
firstChar(users.name);
// Error: Argument of type 'string | undefined' is not
// assignable to parameter of type 'string'.
```

Now the compiler knows `users.name` is `string | undefined` and that `firstChar` only accepts `string`. It
refuses to compile until you handle the `undefined` case - with a default, a guard (`if (users.name)`), or
the narrowing from [Phase 5](05-unions-and-narrowing.md). The bug is caught *at edit-time*, before the code
ever runs. That's the entire point of TypeScript, and it only works with strict on.

⚠️ **Never start a new project with strict off.** Turning strict on later, after thousands of lines, surfaces
a mountain of errors at once and tempts everyone to slap `any` everywhere or give up. Strict from line one
keeps the cost continuous and tiny. The only good reason to disable pieces of it is gradually migrating a
giant legacy codebase - and even then, turn the checks *on* one at a time, never leave them off forever.

## The build - where TypeScript meets the bundler

One last thing trips up nearly everyone: TypeScript can't run in a browser or Node directly, so *something*
has to turn `.ts` into `.js`. Two common arrangements:

**Option 1 - `tsc` does the build.** Run `tsc` and it both type-checks and emits JavaScript into `outDir`.
Simple, no extra tools, perfect for a library or a small Node program.

```bash
$ tsc
$ node dist/checkout.js
19.99 USD
```

`tsc` checked every file under `src/` and wrote compiled JavaScript to `dist/`. Then plain `node` ran the
output. One tool, whole job done.

**Option 2 - a bundler builds, `tsc` only checks.** Real front-end apps more commonly split the work. A fast
bundler or transpiler (Vite, esbuild, swc) handles the `.ts` → `.js` step as part of bundling, alongside
tree-shaking, code-splitting, and the other things from the
[JavaScript modules & bundlers phase](/guides/javascript-from-zero). Those tools are *fast* because they
**strip types without checking them**. So `tsc` runs separately, purely as the type checker, with a flag
that tells it to check and emit nothing:

```bash
$ tsc --noEmit
$ vite build
```

`tsc --noEmit` type-checked the whole project and produced *zero* output - its only job is to say "the types
are sound" (or fail the build if not). Then `vite build` did the actual transformation and bundling. Two
tools, two jobs: one guards correctness, the other produces the shippable files.

💡 **In real apps, the bundler builds and `tsc` just checks.** This split confuses people because the type
*errors* and the actual *build* come from different tools. It's worth it because bundlers transpile blazingly
fast precisely by *not* type-checking, giving instant rebuilds during development, while a separate
`tsc --noEmit` (often in CI, or a watch task) enforces type safety without slowing the build. The types still
protect you - verified by `tsc`, just not by the thing producing your JavaScript.

That closes the loop: a checker, a config file driving it, the settings that matter, strict mode keeping it
honest, and a clear picture of who emits the JavaScript.

## Recap

1. **TypeScript uses ES modules** - the same `import`/`export` as JavaScript - and both **types and values**
   travel through them; the compiler sorts out which is which.
2. **`import type { ... }`** marks a type-only import so it's fully erased from the build, keeping types out
   of your bundle and documenting that nothing runtime crosses that boundary.
3. **`tsconfig.json`** is the control panel: it tells `tsc` (and your editor) which files to include, how
   strictly to check, and what JavaScript to emit. `tsc` reads it automatically.
4. The options that earn their keep: **`target`** (which JS version to emit), **`module`** (format),
   **`outDir`/`rootDir`**, **`lib`**, **`sourceMap`**, and **`declaration`** - each a single decision about
   checking or output.
5. ⚠️ **`strict: true` is non-negotiable for new projects** - it bundles `strictNullChecks`, `noImplicitAny`,
   and more, and makes TypeScript actually catch `null`/`undefined` bugs instead of nodding along.
6. **`tsc` can build, or a bundler builds while `tsc --noEmit` just checks** - the common front-end setup,
   where Vite/esbuild produce fast output and `tsc` guards correctness separately.

## Quick check
