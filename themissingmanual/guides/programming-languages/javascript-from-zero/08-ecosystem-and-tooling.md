# The Ecosystem & Tooling - npm, Runtimes, and the Tools Everyone Uses

You can write perfectly good JavaScript with nothing but a text file and a browser. But the moment you join a real project, you're surrounded by tooling - `package.json`, `node_modules`, a `npm run dev` someone told you to type, configs for things called Prettier and ESLint. None of it is mandatory to *write* JavaScript, but all of it is mandatory to *work with other people's* JavaScript.

Here's the map, in the order you actually meet the pieces - once you know the job each tool does, the config files stop being scary and start being obvious.

## npm - the package manager

**npm** ("Node Package Manager") does two jobs: it downloads code other people wrote (**packages**) into your project, and it runs the **scripts** you've defined. It ships with Node, so if you have Node, you have npm.

📝 **Terminology.** A *package* (or *dependency*) is reusable code published to the npm registry - a date library, a web framework, a testing tool. A *package manager* installs them and tracks which versions you used.

Install something, and npm records it:

```console
$ npm install dayjs
added 1 package in 1s
```
*What just happened:* npm downloaded the `dayjs` package into `node_modules/` and added it to `package.json` under `dependencies` - so anyone who clones your project can run `npm install` and get the exact same packages.

### package.json - the project's identity card

`package.json` describes your project: its name, its dependencies, and its **scripts** - named shortcuts for commands.

```json
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "test": "vitest",
    "format": "prettier --write ."
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "dayjs": "^1.11.0"
  }
}
```
*What just happened:* The `scripts` block defines names you run with `npm run <name>` - instead of remembering `vite build`, type `npm run build` (`npm test` and `npm start` are special - drop the `run`). `"type": "module"` tells Node to treat your `.js` files as ES modules, so `import`/`export` work (see [Phase 5](05-modules-and-project-layout.md)).

```console
$ npm run dev

  VITE v5.4.0  ready in 412 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```
*What just happened:* `npm run dev` looked up `"dev"` in your scripts, found `vite`, and ran it - starting a local dev server you can open in a browser. The command you'll type a hundred times a day.

⚠️ **Gotcha: `node_modules` is huge and regenerable - never commit it.** That folder routinely holds tens of thousands of files and hundreds of megabytes, rebuildable anytime from `package.json` with `npm install`. Committing it bloats your repo and causes endless merge conflicts. Put it in `.gitignore`:

```console
$ cat .gitignore
node_modules/
```
*What just happened:* Git now ignores `node_modules/` entirely. What you *do* commit is `package.json` and `package-lock.json` (which pins exact versions) - enough for anyone to reproduce your dependencies.

## Where JavaScript runs - the runtime split

JavaScript needs a **runtime**: a program that actually executes it. Two you'll meet first, and two newer ones worth a sentence.

📝 **Terminology.** A *runtime* is the environment that runs your JavaScript and gives it abilities beyond the language itself (reading files, making network requests, talking to a screen).

- **The browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari…) runs JavaScript to make web pages interactive - gives you the DOM and `fetch`, but deliberately *can't* read your filesystem.
- **Node.js** runs JavaScript outside the browser - servers, laptops, build tools. Gives you `fs`, networking, and npm packages, but has *no* DOM (there's no page).

That's the split behind a thousand "why doesn't this work" moments: `document` is undefined in Node because Node has no page; `fs` is undefined in the browser because pages can't touch your disk.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  JS[Your JavaScript] --> B[Browser runtime]
  JS --> N[Node runtime]
  B --> BD[DOM + fetch, no filesystem]
  N --> ND[fs + servers, no DOM]
```

*What this shows:* Same language, two homes, different superpowers. Knowing *which* runtime your code runs in tells you which APIs are available.

> 💡 **Deno and Bun** are newer alternatives to Node that run JavaScript (and TypeScript directly), aiming for better defaults and speed. Ignore them while learning - Node is still the default you'll meet first - but now you know the names.

## The supporting cast - four tools you'll see everywhere

These aren't part of the language - they're npm packages a project pulls in to make life better. You don't need them to start, but you'll meet them fast.

**Bundler - Vite.** In a real app your code is split across dozens of module files, and the browser would be slow fetching each one. A **bundler** combines and optimizes them into a few tight files, and (in dev) gives instant reloading as you edit. **Vite** is the popular modern choice - you saw it as the `dev` and `build` scripts above.

**Formatter - Prettier.** Argues with nobody about spaces vs. tabs - it just reformats your code to one consistent style automatically, so the whole codebase looks the same.

**Linter - ESLint.** A formatter cares how code *looks*; a **linter** cares whether code is *suspect* - unused variables, `==` where you meant `===`, a forgotten `await`. It flags likely bugs before you run anything.

**Test runner - Vitest / Jest.** Runs your automated tests and reports pass/fail. **Jest** is the long-time standard; **Vitest** is the newer one that pairs naturally with Vite. Either way, `npm test` runs them.

Here's the supporting cast at work in one session:

```console
$ npm run format            # Prettier rewrites files to one style
$ npx eslint .              # ESLint flags suspicious code
/src/app.js
  12:7  warning  'count' is assigned a value but never used  no-unused-vars
  ✖ 1 problem (0 errors, 1 warning)
$ npm test                  # Vitest runs the test suite
 ✓ src/math.test.js (3 tests) 4ms
 Test Files  1 passed (1)
      Tests  3 passed (3)
```
*What just happened:* Three tools, three jobs. Prettier silently tidied formatting. ESLint read the same files and warned that `count` is declared but never used - a likely mistake, caught before runtime. Vitest ran the tests and reported all green. `npx` (ships with npm) runs a package's command without a script entry - handy for one-offs.

📝 **Terminology.** *Linting* is static analysis: inspecting code *without running it* to spot likely bugs and bad patterns. *Formatting* is purely cosmetic - rearranging the same code for consistent looks.

## How the pieces fit

A typical project flows like this: npm installs the dependencies, your editor + Prettier + ESLint keep the source clean as you write, Vite bundles it for the browser, and Vitest proves it works - all triggered through `package.json` scripts.

You don't need to set any of this up by hand on day one - `npm create vite@latest` scaffolds a project with most of it wired up. The value here isn't configuring the tools, it's *recognizing* them, so opening someone's repo and seeing these files, you already know what each one does.

## Recap

1. **npm** installs packages into `node_modules/` and runs **scripts** defined in `package.json` (`npm run dev`, `npm test`).
2. **`node_modules` is huge and regenerable** - gitignore it; commit `package.json` + `package-lock.json` instead.
3. JavaScript runs in two main **runtimes**: the **browser** (DOM, `fetch`, no filesystem) and **Node** (`fs`, servers, no DOM); **Deno/Bun** are newer alternatives.
4. **Vite** bundles many source files into fast browser files; **Prettier** formats, **ESLint** lints (flags likely bugs), **Vitest/Jest** run tests.
5. You don't configure all this by hand - you *recognize* it; scaffolders like `npm create vite@latest` wire it up for you.
