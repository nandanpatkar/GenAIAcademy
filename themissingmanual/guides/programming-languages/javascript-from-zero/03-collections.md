# Collections - Arrays & Objects

Real programs deal with *many* things - a list of users, the fields of a form, the items in a cart.
JavaScript has two workhorse collections for this: the **array** (an ordered list) and the **object** (a
labeled bundle). Get these two fluent and a huge amount of JavaScript opens up.

## Arrays: ordered lists

An array is an ordered list of values, written with square brackets. Values can be any type, and you
reach into the list by *position* - counting from **0**, not 1.
```javascript runnable
const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
console.log(fruits[0]);     // first item
console.log(fruits[2]);     // third item
console.log(fruits.length); // how many items
```
```console
apple
cherry
3
```
*What just happened:* `fruits[0]` is the first element, since array indexes start at zero - universal
across most languages. `fruits[2]` is the third. `.length` gives the item count. A nonexistent index
(`fruits[99]`) gives `undefined`, not an error.

You can add and change items:
```javascript runnable
const fruits = ["apple", "banana"];
fruits.push("cherry");   // add to the end
fruits[0] = "apricot";   // replace the first item
console.log(fruits);
```
```console
[ 'apricot', 'banana', 'cherry' ]
```
*What just happened:* `.push(...)` appended `"cherry"` to the end; `fruits[0] = "apricot"` overwrote the
first slot. The array is a `const` and yet we changed its *contents* - allowed, for a reason that's the
most important idea in this phase (more below).

### A taste of array methods: `map`, `filter`, `reduce`

Arrays come with built-in methods that transform lists without manual loops. These three you'll reach for
constantly, so meet them now even if they feel like a lot at first.

**`map`** makes a *new* array by transforming every item:
```javascript runnable
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const doubled = numbers.map((n) => n * 2);
console.log(doubled);
```
```console
[ 2, 4, 6 ]
```
*What just happened:* `.map(...)` walked `numbers`, ran `(n) => n * 2` on each item, and collected the
results into a brand-new array. (That's an **arrow function** - covered properly in
[Phase 4](04-control-flow-and-functions.md); for now read it as "given `n`, give back `n * 2`.") The
original `numbers` is untouched.

**`filter`** makes a new array keeping only the items that pass a test:
```javascript runnable
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
const evens = numbers.filter((n) => n % 2 === 0);
console.log(evens);
```
```console
[ 2, 4, 6 ]
```
*What just happened:* `.filter(...)` kept each item only when `n % 2 === 0` ("remainder on dividing by 2
is zero," i.e. even) returned `true`; the odd numbers were dropped. Again, a new array comes out and the
original stays put.

**`reduce`** boils a whole array down to a single value:
```javascript runnable
const numbers = [10, 20, 30];
const total = numbers.reduce((sum, n) => sum + n, 0);
console.log(total);
```
```console
60
```
*What just happened:* `.reduce(...)` carries a running value (`sum`) across the list, starting at `0`
(the second argument), adding each item on: `0+10`, `+20`, `+30`, landing on `60`. Most powerful and
least obvious of the three - mental model: "fold the list into one result, one item at a time."

💡 **Key point.** `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` all return *new* values and leave the original array
alone. Building new data instead of mutating old data prevents a whole class of bugs, and it reads like a
sentence: "take the numbers, *filter* the evens, *map* them doubled."

## Objects: labeled bundles

Where an array holds values by *position*, an object holds values by *name* - a bundle of `key: value`
pairs in curly braces, perfect for representing one "thing" with several properties.
```javascript runnable
const user = {
  name: "Ada",
  age: 36,
  isAdmin: true,
};
console.log(user.name);     // dot notation
console.log(user["age"]);   // bracket notation
```
```console
Ada
36
```
*What just happened:* `user` bundles three labeled values, read by key either with a dot (`user.name` -
what you'll use most) or with brackets and the key as a string (`user["age"]` - needed when the key is in
a variable or has unusual characters).

You change and add properties freely:
```javascript runnable
const user = { name: "Ada" };
user.age = 36;        // add a new property
user.name = "Ada L."; // change an existing one
console.log(user);
```
```console
{ name: 'Ada L.', age: 36 }
```
*What just happened:* Assigning to `user.age` (a key that didn't exist) *added* it; assigning to
`user.name` *changed* it. Objects are open for extension by default.

📝 **Terminology.** A **property** is one `key: value` pair on an object; a **method** is a property
whose value is a function (e.g. `console.log` is the `log` method of the `console` object). Arrays are
technically a special kind of object too - why they have methods like `.push()`.

## A one-line note on `Map` and `Set`

For most "labeled data," a plain object is exactly right. But JavaScript also has two purpose-built
collections worth *knowing the names of*: a **`Map`** is like an object but its keys can be *any* type
(not just strings) and it remembers insertion order cleanly; a **`Set`** is a list that automatically
rejects duplicates. Reach for them when those powers matter; until then, arrays and objects cover most
real code.

## ⚠️ The big one: reference vs. value

This single idea explains the `const`-but-still-changeable puzzle from earlier, *and* a bug that bites
every JavaScript developer. Pay attention here.

**Primitives are copied by value. Objects and arrays are shared by reference.** Assign a number or string
and you copy the value. Assign an object or array and you copy a *reference* - a pointer to the same
underlying thing. Two names, one object.
```javascript runnable
const a = { count: 1 };
const b = a;        // b points at the SAME object as a
b.count = 99;
console.log(a.count);
```
```console
99
```
*What just happened:* `const b = a` did **not** make a second object - it made `b` point at the *exact
same* object `a` points at, so changing `b.count` also changed `a.count`. This surprises everyone the
first time. (Compare with primitives: `let x = 1; let y = x; y = 99;` leaves `x` as `1`, because the
number was copied.)

This is also why a `const` array can still be `push`ed into: `const` locks the *name* to one object, but
the object's *insides* stay free to change. `const` protects the pointer, not the contents.

And it's why two equal-looking objects aren't equal:
```javascript runnable
console.log({ x: 1 } === { x: 1 });   // two separate objects
const same = { x: 1 };
console.log(same === same);           // the same object
```
```console
false
true
```
*What just happened:* The first comparison is `false` because those are *two different objects* that
merely *look* alike - `===` on objects asks "are these the same object?", not "do they contain the same
stuff?" The second is `true` because both sides are literally the same object. To compare *contents*,
compare the fields yourself (or use a library) - source of countless "but they're the same!" debugging
sessions.

🪖 **War story.** A classic bug: copy an array with `const copy = original`, tweak `copy`, and later
discover `original` changed too - they were always the same array. The fix: make a *real* copy with
`const copy = [...original]` (array) or `const copy = { ...original }` (object). That `...` is the
"spread" syntax; it builds a new collection with the old one's items shallow-copied in. Keep it in your
back pocket.

## Recap

1. **Arrays** are ordered lists indexed from **0**; `.length` counts them, `.push()` appends.
2. **`map`/`filter`/`reduce`** transform / select / fold an array into a *new* value, leaving the original
   alone.
3. **Objects** are `key: value` bundles read with `.dot` or `["bracket"]` notation; properties can be
   added and changed freely.
4. **`Map`** (any-type keys) and **`Set`** (no duplicates) exist for special cases - know the names.
5. **Reference vs. value:** objects and arrays are *shared*, not copied, on assignment. This explains
   `const` arrays you can still mutate, and why `{x:1} === {x:1}` is `false`. Copy with `[...a]` / `{...o}`.

Next: control flow - the logic that decides *which* code runs and *how often* - and functions, which let
you name and reuse blocks of behavior.
