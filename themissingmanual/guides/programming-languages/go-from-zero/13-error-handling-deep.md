# Error Handling, Deep - Wrapping, Inspecting & Recovering

Back in [Phase 7](07-errors-and-io.md) you learned the foundational truth of Go errors: an error is just a value. Return `(result, error)`, check `if err != nil`, deal with the failure right where it happened. That's enough to write honest, correct Go - but it's the *floor*, not the ceiling.

Here's the problem once programs get real. An error bubbles up through five function calls and lands in your logs as a bare `not found`. Not found *what*? By *whom*? At *which step*? The error has no memory of its own journey. This phase gives errors a memory, and your code the tools to interrogate it later.

The mental model: an error is a package that travels up the call stack. At each level, a function can *wrap* it in a new layer, writing its own note on the outside ("loading config: …") without discarding what's underneath, so by the top it carries the whole story. Wrapping writes it; `errors.Is` and `errors.As` read it back.

## Adding context by wrapping with `%w`

You met `%w` briefly in Phase 7 - now let's look at what it actually builds.

📝 **Wrapping** - enclosing an existing error inside a new one that adds context, while keeping a link back to the original. The result is an **error chain**: a stack of errors where each layer knows the one beneath it, built with `fmt.Errorf` using the `%w` ("wrap") verb.

The distinction that matters: `%v` *formats* an error into a string and forgets it; `%w` *links* the new error to the original so it can be recovered later. Same readable message, but only `%w` preserves the chain.

```go
package main

import (
	"errors"
	"fmt"
)

var ErrPermission = errors.New("permission denied")

func readSecret() error {
	return ErrPermission // the low-level failure
}

func loadConfig() error {
	if err := readSecret(); err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("loading config: %w", err) // wrap it
	}
	return nil
}

func startServer() error {
	if err := loadConfig(); err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("starting server: %w", err) // wrap again
	}
	return nil
}

func main() {
	err := startServer()
	fmt.Println(err)
}
```
```console
$ go run main.go
starting server: loading config: permission denied
```
*What just happened:* Each function added its own note with `%w` as the error travelled up, reading outside-in like a breadcrumb trail: top-level intent (`starting server`), sub-step (`loading config`), root cause (`permission denied`) - no manual string concatenation, each layer wrapped the one below. Crucially, the original `ErrPermission` is *still in there*, recoverable, not flattened into text - what makes the next section possible.

💡 **Key point.** A good wrap message describes what *this layer* was trying to do - `loading config`, `fetching user 42` - not a restatement of the error below it. Don't end it with a colon or the error itself; `%w` appends that for you.

## Inspecting wrapped errors: `errors.Is` and `errors.As`

A chain you can read with your eyes is nice; a chain your *code* can read is what makes wrapping powerful. Once wrapped, you can no longer ask "is this the not-found error?" with `==`, because you're holding the *outer* wrapper, not the original.

⚠️ **Gotcha - `==` only sees the outermost layer.** After `fmt.Errorf("loading config: %w", ErrPermission)`, the value you hold is a brand-new error whose identity is *not* `ErrPermission`, so `err == ErrPermission` is `false` even though `ErrPermission` sits one layer down. Comparing wrapped errors with `==` silently misses the match - the single most common wrapping bug.

The fix: two standard-library functions that walk the *entire* chain for you.

- **`errors.Is(err, target)`** - returns true if `err`, or anything it wraps, *is* the specific sentinel value `target`. Use it to answer "is this (somewhere) a known error?"
- **`errors.As(err, &target)`** - returns true if `err`, or anything it wraps, is of a specific *type*; if so, it fills in `target` so you can read that type's fields. Use it to answer "is this a known *kind* of error, and what's inside it?"

Here's `errors.Is` matching through the same three-layer chain from above:

```go
package main

import (
	"errors"
	"fmt"
)

var ErrPermission = errors.New("permission denied")

func startServer() error {
	return fmt.Errorf("starting server: %w",
		fmt.Errorf("loading config: %w", ErrPermission))
}

func main() {
	err := startServer()

	fmt.Println("== check:  ", err == ErrPermission)      // outer wrapper, not equal
	fmt.Println("Is check:  ", errors.Is(err, ErrPermission)) // walks the chain
}
```
```console
$ go run main.go
== check:   false
Is check:   true
```
*What just happened:* `err == ErrPermission` was `false` - the outermost wrapper, a different object entirely. But `errors.Is` peeled the chain layer by layer, found `ErrPermission` at the bottom, and matched it. That's the whole reason `errors.Is` exists: identity through wrapping. Reach for it any time you'd write `err == someKnownError`.

## Sentinel errors - a known value to match against

Both examples above lean on `var ErrPermission = errors.New(...)` - a **sentinel error**, worth naming as a pattern.

📝 **Sentinel error** - a package-level error value, declared once with `errors.New`, that callers compare against with `errors.Is` to recognize a specific, expected condition. The name conventionally starts with `Err`; the standard library is full of them: `io.EOF`, `sql.ErrNoRows`, `os.ErrNotExist`.

They shine when a failure is a single, well-known *condition* the caller will branch on - "the row wasn't found," "we hit end of file" - via `if errors.Is(err, sql.ErrNoRows)`.

```go
package main

import (
	"errors"
	"fmt"
)

var ErrNotFound = errors.New("user not found")

func findUser(id int) error {
	if id != 1 {
		return fmt.Errorf("findUser(%d): %w", id, ErrNotFound)
	}
	return nil
}

func main() {
	err := findUser(99)
	if errors.Is(err, ErrNotFound) {
		fmt.Println("handle gracefully: show a 404")
	} else if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("some other failure:", err)
	}
}
```
```console
$ go run main.go
handle gracefully: show a 404
```
*What just happened:* `findUser` wrapped the sentinel with call context, and the caller used `errors.Is` to recognize *exactly* the not-found case and respond (a 404) while letting other errors fall through. The sentinel is shared vocabulary: the producer publishes `ErrNotFound`, the consumer matches on it.

⚠️ **Gotcha - sentinels are an API promise.** Once you export `ErrNotFound`, every caller writing `errors.Is(err, ErrNotFound)` is *coupled* to it - you can't rename or remove it without breaking them, and you can't attach per-occurrence detail (which user? which id?) since it's one shared, immutable value. Sentinels suit plain yes/no conditions; when the caller needs *structured data*, you've outgrown them - what custom error types are for.

## Custom error types - errors that carry data

A sentinel says "this kind of thing went wrong." A custom error type says "here are the specifics" - an ordinary struct satisfying the `error` interface via an `Error() string` method, a real error you can return but with fields callers can pull out.

📝 **Custom error type** - a struct implementing `error` (an `Error() string` method), letting a single error value carry structured fields (a field name, a code, an offending value). Callers extract it from a chain with `errors.As`.

`errors.Is` checks identity against a value; `errors.As` checks for a *type* and hands you the value so you can read its fields.

```go
package main

import (
	"errors"
	"fmt"
)

// A struct that is also an error.
type ValidationError struct {
	Field string
	Msg   string
}

func (e *ValidationError) Error() string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("validation failed on %q: %s", e.Field, e.Msg)
}

func register(age int) error {
	if age < 0 {
		return fmt.Errorf("register: %w",
			&ValidationError{Field: "age", Msg: "must not be negative"})
	}
	return nil
}

func main() {
	err := register(-5)

	var ve *ValidationError
	if errors.As(err, &ve) { // pull the concrete type out of the chain
		fmt.Println("field that failed:", ve.Field)
		fmt.Println("full message:     ", err)
	}
}
```
```console
$ go run main.go
field that failed: age
full message:      register: validation failed on "age": must not be negative
```
*What just happened:* `ValidationError`'s `Error()` method makes it an `error`, so `register` wrapped and returned it like any other. `errors.As(err, &ve)` walked the chain, found a `*ValidationError` underneath, and copied it into `ve` - structured detail (`ve.Field` is `"age"`), not just a string to parse. The power split: `errors.Is` for "is it this specific error?", `errors.As` for "is it this *kind*, and give me its data."

💡 **Key point.** Note the pointer receiver and the `&` everywhere - return `&ValidationError{...}`, match with `var ve *ValidationError; errors.As(err, &ve)`. Using a pointer type consistently avoids a subtle mismatch where `errors.As` won't find a value type when you searched for a pointer. Pick pointer, stay pointer.

## `panic` and `recover` - the rare escape hatch

Everything so far has been *expected* failures - a missing file, garbage input, an absent user. Go has a *second*, separate mechanism for a different category of problem: `panic`.

📝 **`panic`** - stops normal execution immediately, runs deferred functions as it unwinds the stack, and crashes the program with a stack trace. **`recover`** - callable only inside a deferred function, catches a panic mid-unwind and lets the program carry on instead of dying.

The reason Go has these but says to almost never use them: errors are for failures you *expected could happen*; panic is for situations that *should be impossible*. A missing file is a Tuesday - return an error. An index out of range on a slice you just built, a `nil` pointer you swore was set, a `switch` hitting a `default` your own invariants say can't occur - those are *bugs*, states the author thought unreachable. There's no sensible "handle it and continue" for a violated assumption, so panic crashes loudly with a stack trace to fix it.

⚠️ **Gotcha - don't use panic for normal control flow.** Coming from exception-based languages it's tempting to `panic` on bad input and `recover` up top instead of threading `error` returns through. Resist it: panic skips the explicit, checkable error path Go is built around, unwinds invisibly across function boundaries, and - the real teeth - a panic escaping a goroutine crashes the *entire process*, since `recover` only works in the same goroutine that's unwinding. Errors-as-values is the road; panic is the emergency exit.

So when is `recover` legitimate? At a **boundary** where one unit of work must not take down the whole program - a server handling many requests. If one request panics from a bug deep in a handler, you'd rather fail *that one request* than crash the process for everyone else.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// handle runs one request and converts any panic into a returned error,
// so a bug in handling one request can't crash the whole server.
func handle(req string) (err error) {
	defer func() {
		if r := recover(); r != nil {
			err = fmt.Errorf("recovered from panic handling %q: %v", req, r)
		}
	}()

	if req == "bad" {
		panic("unexpected nil in handler") // simulate a bug deep in the call stack
	}
	fmt.Printf("handled %q OK\n", req)
	return nil
}

func main() {
	for _, req := range []string{"good", "bad", "good"} {
		if err := handle(req); err != nil {
			fmt.Println("ERROR:", err)
		}
	}
	fmt.Println("server still running")
}
```
```console
$ go run main.go
handled "good" OK
ERROR: recovered from panic handling "bad": unexpected nil in handler
server still running
```
*What just happened:* The `"bad"` request panicked - normally a program-ending event. But `handle`'s deferred `recover()` caught the panic value mid-unwind and turned it into an ordinary `error` assigned to the named return `err`. The panic was *contained* at the request boundary: that request failed, the loop continued, the next `"good"` request ran normally - the program survived. This recover-at-the-boundary pattern is the main legitimate use of `recover`: a safety net for bugs, not a handler for expected failures.

💡 **The rule, in one line.** Return an `error` for anything that could reasonably happen; `panic` only for "this should never happen." A sentence describing when the failure occurs normally means error; "a bug in my code" means panic.

## Recap

1. **Wrap to add context.** `fmt.Errorf("doing X: %w", err)` encloses an error in a new layer while keeping a link to the original, building an **error chain** that reads outside-in. `%w` preserves the chain; `%v` only formats text.
2. **Inspect with `errors.Is`.** Walks the whole chain to match a known **sentinel** value. ⚠️ Never use `==` on a wrapped error - it sees only the outermost layer.
3. **Extract with `errors.As`.** Walks the chain to find a specific error *type* and fills your variable so you can read its fields - the tool for **custom error types**.
4. **Sentinels vs. custom types.** Use a sentinel (`var ErrX = errors.New(...)`) for a plain known *condition*; use a custom struct error when callers need *structured data*. Sentinels are an API promise; types carry detail.
5. **`panic` is not error handling.** Return errors for expected failures; reserve `panic` for impossible states (bugs). ⚠️ A panic that escapes a goroutine crashes the whole process.
6. **`recover` at a boundary.** A deferred `recover()` can contain a panic at a request/job boundary so one bad unit of work doesn't kill the program - a safety net, not a control-flow tool.

You now make errors carry their own story and read it back in code. Next: the **runtime** - how the scheduler juggles goroutines onto OS threads, and how Go's memory and garbage collector keep it all fast.

## Quick check

Test yourself on the two ideas that do the heavy lifting here - wrapping and the panic/error divide:

    ],
