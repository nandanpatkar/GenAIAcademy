# Go From Zero

You keep hearing that Go is the language behind Docker, Kubernetes, and half the cloud - that it's fast,
simple, and great at doing a thousand things at once. Then you open a Go file and it looks oddly bare:
no classes, no exceptions, a loop that doesn't say `while`, and a compiler that flat-out *refuses* to
build your program over an unused variable. That bareness isn't an accident, and it isn't something to
fight. Go was deliberately kept small so that a whole team can read each other's code without surprises.

This guide takes you the whole way: from "I've never written a line of Go" to understanding what the
language and its runtime are *actually doing* underneath your code. We'll go mental-model-first the whole
way: before any command, you'll understand what the thing actually *is* and why Go made the choice it did.

It's one zero-to-hero journey in two halves. **Phases 1–9 are the basics** - enough to read real Go,
structure a project, and use the concurrency it's famous for. **Phases 10–17 are the deep half** -
interfaces, generics, real concurrency patterns, the runtime scheduler and garbage collector, testing
and profiling, the standard library, and performance, the stuff that separates "writes Go" from
"understands Go." Each phase carries a difficulty badge so you can see the climb.

If you've never programmed at all, you'll want a gentler on-ramp first - start with
[Programming From Zero](/guides/programming-from-zero), then come back here.

## How to read this

- **Brand new to Go? Read 1–9 in order.** Each phase builds on the last. Phases 1–5 give you the language
  and how to organize it; phase 6 is the payoff (concurrency); 7–9 round you out into someone who can
  ship. Come back for 10+ when the basics feel comfortable.
- **Already know another language?** Skim phases 1–5 to catch where Go is *deliberately different* (one
  loop, multiple returns, exported = capitalized, no exceptions), then **slow down at phase 6** -
  goroutines and channels are where Go stops looking familiar and starts being Go.
- **Past the basics already?** Jump to the deep half - [Phase 10: Interfaces in Depth](10-interfaces-in-depth.md)
  onward is where Go stops being "a small, readable language" and starts being one you can reason about
  down to the scheduler.

## The phases

**Part 1 - The basics (🟢 Basic → 🟡 Intermediate)**
1. **[Install & Your First Program](01-install-and-first-program.md)** 🟢 - the Go toolchain, `hello.go`, and the refusal to compile unused code.
2. **[Syntax, Values & Types](02-syntax-values-and-types.md)** 🟢 - `var` vs `:=`, static typing, the basic types, and zero values.
3. **[Collections](03-collections.md)** 🟢 - arrays vs slices, `append`, maps, and looping with `range`.
4. **[Control Flow & Functions](04-control-flow-and-functions.md)** 🟢 - the single `for`, `if`, `switch`, and multiple return values.
5. **[Modules & Project Layout](05-modules-and-project-layout.md)** 🟢 - `go mod init`, packages, exported = capitalized, a sane layout.
6. **[Goroutines & Channels](06-goroutines-and-channels.md)** 🟡 - the reason Go exists: many things at once, safely, with `go` and channels.
7. **[Errors & I/O](07-errors-and-io.md)** 🟡 - "errors are values" (no exceptions), and reading/writing files and streams.
8. **[Ecosystem & Tooling](08-ecosystem-and-tooling.md)** 🟡 - `go test`, `go fmt`, `go vet`, modules, the batteries-included toolchain.
9. **[Idioms & Gotchas](09-idioms-and-gotchas.md)** 🟡 - how Go programmers actually write Go, and the traps that bite everyone once.

**Part 2 - Beyond the basics (🔴 Advanced)**
10. **[Interfaces in Depth](10-interfaces-in-depth.md)** 🔴 - interface values as (type, value) pairs, type assertions and switches, the nil-interface trap.
11. **[Generics & Advanced Types](11-generics-and-advanced-types.md)** 🔴 - type parameters, constraints, method sets, and when generics beat interfaces.
12. **[Concurrency Patterns](12-concurrency-patterns.md)** 🔴 - `select`, `context`, worker pools, fan-in/out, the `sync` toolbox, the race detector.
13. **[Error Handling, Deep](13-error-handling-deep.md)** 🟡 - wrapping with `%w`, `errors.Is`/`As`, sentinel and custom errors, `panic`/`recover`.
14. **[The Runtime: Scheduler, Memory & GC](14-runtime-scheduler-and-memory.md)** 🔴 - the GMP scheduler, stack vs heap, escape analysis, the garbage collector.
15. **[Testing, Benchmarks & Profiling](15-testing-benchmarks-profiling.md)** 🟡 - table-driven tests, benchmarks, `pprof`, coverage, fuzzing.
16. **[The Standard Library as Design](16-standard-library.md)** 🟡 - `io.Reader`/`Writer`, `context`, `encoding/json`, `net/http` as a masterclass.
17. **[Performance & Optimization](17-performance-and-optimization.md)** 🔴 - cutting allocations, `sync.Pool`, and profile-driven optimization.

**Finale**
18. **[Where to Go Next](18-where-to-go-next.md)** 🟢 - web, CLIs, cloud & infra, and what to actually build.

> Frameworks and big projects (gRPC, Kubernetes internals, cgo) are their own world - this guide makes
> the *language and its runtime* make sense, top to bottom.
