# Errors & I/O - Errors Are Values

If you're coming from a language with exceptions, Go's error handling will feel either refreshing or relentless, and usually both. There's no `try`/`catch`, no invisible stack-unwinding to a handler three floors up:

> **An error is just a value.** A function that can fail returns one, right alongside its result, and you deal with it then and there.

An error isn't a special control-flow event - it's data. The function hands back "here's the answer, and here's what went wrong (or `nil` if nothing did)." That's why `if err != nil` is everywhere in Go: the language insists you look at the failure at the exact spot it happened, while you still have context to act.

## The `if err != nil` pattern

By convention, a Go function that can fail returns its result *and* an `error` as its last value. Check the error immediately; if it's not `nil`, something went wrong.

📝 **Terminology.** `error` is a built-in interface - anything with an `Error() string` method is an error. The zero value of an error is `nil`, meaning "no error." So `err != nil` literally reads as "an error is present."

`strconv.Atoi` turns a string into an int, and it can fail (the string might not be a number):
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strconv"
)

func main() {
	n, err := strconv.Atoi("42")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("could not parse:", err)
		return
	}
	fmt.Println("parsed:", n)
}
```
```console
$ go run main.go
parsed: 42
```
`Atoi` returned two values: the parsed number `42` and an error. We checked `err` right away; it was `nil`, so we trusted `n` and printed it. Passing `"oops"` instead would make `err` non-nil (`strconv.Atoi: parsing "oops": invalid syntax`), taking the error branch. Result and error come back *together*, and you decide what to do with the failure on the spot.

⚠️ **Gotcha - ignoring the error.** Go lets you discard a return value with `_`, and the single most common Go mistake is doing that to the error:
```go
n, _ := strconv.Atoi(userInput) // DON'T: if userInput is garbage, n is silently 0
```
You threw the error away. If `userInput` was `"abc"`, `Atoi` returned `0` for `n` *and* a non-nil error explaining why - but ignoring it means holding `0` as if the parse succeeded. The bug surfaces later, far from the cause, as a mysterious zero. The whole point of errors-as-values is that you *see* them; `_` throws that away. (The `errcheck` linter, part of `golangci-lint` in the next phase, catches exactly this.)

## Returning errors from your own functions

When your function can fail, follow the same convention: return `(result, error)`. Pass a downstream error back up, or create your own with `errors.New` or `fmt.Errorf`.

```go
package main

import (
	"errors"
	"fmt"
)

func half(n int) (int, error) {
	if n%2 != 0 {
		return 0, errors.New("number is odd")
	}
	return n / 2, nil
}

func main() {
	for _, n := range []int{8, 7} {
		h, err := half(n)
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Printf("half(%d): %v\n", n, err)
			continue
		}
		fmt.Printf("half(%d) = %d\n", n, h)
	}
}
```
```console
$ go run main.go
half(8) = 4
half(7): number is odd
```
`half` returned `(result, nil)` on success and `(0, an error)` on failure. The caller checked `err` each time: for `8` it printed the result, for `7` the error. The failed case still returns a real `int` (`0`) - Go requires *all* return values, so convention is a zero/empty result alongside a non-nil error, and the caller knows not to trust the result when the error is set.

## Wrapping errors with `%w`

A bare "file not found" tells you *what* but not *where in your program* it happened. Wrapping adds your context while keeping the original error intact underneath, via `fmt.Errorf` and the special `%w` verb.

**Why this matters.** `%w` doesn't just stuff the old message into a new string - it *links* the new error to the original so tools can still dig it out later (the `errors.Is`/`errors.As` trick below). You get a readable chain: high-level context on the outside, root cause on the inside.

```go
package main

import (
	"errors"
	"fmt"
)

var errNotFound = errors.New("not found")

func loadUser(id int) error {
	return fmt.Errorf("loadUser(%d): %w", id, errNotFound)
}

func main() {
	err := loadUser(7)
	fmt.Println(err)
}
```
```console
$ go run main.go
loadUser(7): not found
```
`fmt.Errorf` built a new message - `loadUser(7): not found` - but `%w` also kept a hidden pointer to the original `errNotFound`. The message reads top-down (context first, root cause last), and the original error is still recoverable. Use `%w` when callers might need the cause; use plain `%v` (just formats the text) when you only need it readable.

## Inspecting errors: `errors.Is` and `errors.As`

Wrapping forms a chain, so you often need to ask: *"is this (anywhere in the chain) a specific known error?"* and *"is this a specific error type, and can I get at its fields?"* That's `errors.Is` and `errors.As`.

- **`errors.Is(err, target)`** - true if `err`, or anything it wraps, *is* that sentinel value. Use it to compare against a known error like `errNotFound` or `os.ErrNotExist`. (Don't use `==` - that only checks the outermost error and misses wrapped ones.)
- **`errors.As(err, &target)`** - true if `err`, or anything it wraps, is of a given *type*; if so it fills `target` so you can read the type's fields.

```go
package main

import (
	"errors"
	"fmt"
)

var errNotFound = errors.New("not found")

func loadUser(id int) error {
	return fmt.Errorf("loadUser(%d): %w", id, errNotFound)
}

func main() {
	err := loadUser(7)
	if errors.Is(err, errNotFound) {
		fmt.Println("yes, this was a not-found error")
	}
}
```
```console
$ go run main.go
yes, this was a not-found error
```
Even though `err`'s text was the wrapped `loadUser(7): not found`, `errors.Is` walked the chain, found `errNotFound` underneath, and matched it. A plain `err == errNotFound` would return false - the outer wrapper isn't equal to the sentinel - exactly why `errors.Is` exists. Reach for `errors.As` (a pointer to a variable of the error type) when you need the structured data inside, not just "is it this kind."

## Reading files: `os` and `bufio`

File and stream handling lives mostly in `os` and `bufio`, and every operation returns an error you check. For a whole small file, `os.ReadFile` gives you the bytes in one call. For reading line by line without loading it all into memory, `bufio.Scanner` is the standard tool.

```go
package main

import (
	"bufio"
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	f, err := os.Open("notes.txt")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("open failed:", err)
		return
	}
	defer f.Close() // always runs, even on early return

	scanner := bufio.NewScanner(f)
	for scanner.Scan() { // advances to the next line; false at EOF
		fmt.Println("line:", scanner.Text())
	}
	if err := scanner.Err(); err != nil { // check for a read error
		fmt.Println("scan failed:", err)
	}
}
```
```console
$ cat notes.txt
buy milk
call dentist
$ go run main.go
line: buy milk
line: call dentist
```
`os.Open` returned the open file and an error; we checked it, then set up `defer f.Close()` so the file closes no matter how the function exits (an idiom covered in [Phase 9](09-idioms-and-gotchas.md)). `bufio.NewScanner` wrapped the file; `scanner.Scan()` returned `true` per line and `false` at end-of-file, and `scanner.Text()` gave the line's contents. After the loop we called `scanner.Err()` - `Scan()` returns `false` both for a clean EOF *and* a read error, and only `scanner.Err()` tells the two apart.

⚠️ **Gotcha.** `scanner.Scan()` returning `false` does **not** mean "success." It means "stop looping" - a normal EOF *or* a real I/O error. Always check `scanner.Err()` after the loop, or a disk error mid-read will look exactly like a clean finish.

## `panic` and `recover` - the rare exception

`panic` *is* Go's exception-like mechanism: it stops normal flow, unwinds the stack running deferred functions, and crashes the program with a stack trace. `recover` (only meaningful inside a `defer`) can catch a panic and stop the unwind. Go wants you to almost never use them for ordinary errors.

**When it's appropriate.** Use `panic` for *truly unrecoverable* programmer errors - an impossible state, a violated invariant, a config too broken to start. Use ordinary error values for normal, expected failures (file missing, bad input, network down). The dividing line: "is this a bug, or a Tuesday?" Bugs may panic; Tuesdays return an error.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func safeDivide(a, b int) (result int, err error) {
	defer func() {
		if r := recover(); r != nil {
			err = fmt.Errorf("recovered from: %v", r)
		}
	}()
	return a / b, nil // dividing by zero panics
}

func main() {
	_, err := safeDivide(10, 0)
	fmt.Println("err:", err)
}
```
```console
$ go run main.go
err: recovered from: runtime error: integer divide by zero
```
`10 / 0` triggered a runtime panic, which would normally crash the program. But the deferred function ran during the unwind, called `recover()` (returning the panic value instead of `nil`), and assigned a normal error to the named return value `err` - converting the panic back into an ordinary error the caller could check. This pattern - recover at a boundary, turn panic into error - is the main legitimate use of `recover`, reserved for guarding against bugs, not expected failures.

⚠️ **Gotcha.** Don't use `panic`/`recover` as cheap exceptions to dodge `if err != nil`. A panic that escapes a goroutine crashes the *entire* program - `recover` only works in the same goroutine that's unwinding. Errors-as-values is the path; panic is the emergency exit.

## Recap

1. **Errors are values** - a fallible function returns `(result, error)`; you check `if err != nil` right there, where you have the context to act.
2. **Return them** - pass downstream errors up; create your own with `errors.New` / `fmt.Errorf`. Return a zero result alongside a non-nil error.
3. **Wrap with `%w`** - `fmt.Errorf("doing X: %w", err)` adds your context while keeping the original error recoverable.
4. **Inspect with `errors.Is` / `errors.As`** - match a sentinel anywhere in the chain (`Is`), or pull out a specific error *type* and its fields (`As`). Don't use `==`.
5. **I/O** - `os.Open` + `bufio.Scanner` reads line by line; `defer f.Close()`; always check `scanner.Err()` after the loop.
6. **`panic`/`recover`** - Go's real exceptions, reserved for unrecoverable bugs, not everyday failures. ⚠️ Never ignore an error with `_`.

You now write code that runs concurrently and fails honestly. Next: stepping back from the language to the *toolbox* around it - the batteries-included commands (`go build`, `go test`, `go fmt`) that make Go projects low-fuss to work in.
