# Interfaces in Depth - Behavior, Not Hierarchy

In [Phase 9](09-idioms-and-gotchas.md) you met interfaces on the surface: small, implicitly satisfied lists of methods, like `io.Writer`. Underneath, though, is what an interface value actually *is* in memory - and once you see it, four separate-feeling quirks (type assertions, type switches, the empty interface, and the "my nil error isn't nil" bug) turn out to be one idea wearing four hats.

The mental model: **an interface value is not the thing you stored in it. It's a tiny box holding two slots - what type the thing is, and the thing itself.**

## The one idea: an interface value is a (type, value) pair

📝 **Interface value** - at runtime, a value of an interface type is a pair: a *dynamic type* (which concrete type is in the box right now) and a *dynamic value* (the actual data, or a pointer to it). The interface is just the box; the pair inside gives it behavior.

Assigning a concrete value to an interface variable makes Go record the concrete type alongside the value - the whole trick behind calling the *right* method later, and asking "what's actually in here?"

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph IF["var w io.Writer"]
    T["type:<br/>*os.File"]
    V["value:<br/>0xc0000a4..."]
  end
  C["os.Stdout<br/>(concrete)"] --> IF
  IF -->|"w.Write(...)"| M["calls<br/>(*os.File).Write"]
```

*What just happened:* assigning `os.Stdout` to an `io.Writer` variable filled both slots - type remembers `*os.File`, value points at the actual file. Calling `w.Write(...)` makes Go read the type slot to find *which* `Write` to run: **dynamic dispatch**, chosen at runtime from the concrete type in the box, not the interface type you declared. Two concrete types behind the same interface call two different methods - the entire point of an interface.

💡 **Why this matters.** Every feature in this phase is "do something with one of those two slots": assertions and switches *read the type slot*, the empty interface is *a box with no method requirements*, the nil trap is *the box being non-empty even when the value slot is nil*.

## Type assertions - getting the concrete value back out

A value inside an interface wears a disguise: you can only call the interface's methods, not the concrete type's other methods or fields. A **type assertion** pulls the disguise off - "I believe the concrete type here is `X`; give it back to me as an `X`."

📝 **Type assertion** - `x.(T)` checks interface value `x`'s dynamic type against `T`. Two forms: *comma-ok* `v, ok := x.(T)` (safe - `ok` tells you whether it matched), and *single-value* `v := x.(T)` (**panics** if the type doesn't match).

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var x any = "hello" // an interface box holding a string

	// comma-ok form: never panics, ok reports the match
	s, ok := x.(string)
	fmt.Println(s, ok)

	n, ok := x.(int) // wrong type - no panic, just ok == false
	fmt.Println(n, ok)

	// single-value form: panics if wrong. Use only when you're certain.
	s2 := x.(string)
	fmt.Println(s2)
}
```
```console
$ go run main.go
hello true
0 false
hello
```

*What just happened:* `x`'s type slot says `string`. `x.(string)` matched, so `s` got `"hello"` and `ok` was `true`; `x.(int)` didn't match, but comma-ok meant no panic - just `n = 0` and `ok = false`. The single-value `s2 := x.(string)` worked because we genuinely had a string; written as `x.(int)` it would have crashed with `panic: interface conversion: interface {} is string, not int`.

⚠️ **Reach for comma-ok by default.** Single-value is fine when a panic is the correct response to a broken assumption, but ordinary code almost always wants `ok` so it can handle "not that type" gracefully instead of taking down the program.

## Type switches - branching on the dynamic type

Chaining assertions for *several* possible concrete types gets ugly fast. The **type switch** reads the type slot and branches, binding the unwrapped value in each case.

📝 **Type switch** - `switch v := x.(type) { case T1: ... case T2: ... }`. The `.(type)` syntax is legal only inside a `switch`. In each `case`, `v` is already converted to that case's type, so you can use it directly.

Here's a small formatter that renders different types in different ways:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Point struct{ X, Y int }

func describe(x any) string {
	switch v := x.(type) {
	case int:
		return fmt.Sprintf("an int, doubled: %d", v*2)
	case string:
		return fmt.Sprintf("a string of length %d", len(v))
	case Point:
		return fmt.Sprintf("a point at (%d, %d)", v.X, v.Y)
	case nil:
		return "nothing at all"
	default:
		return fmt.Sprintf("some other type: %T", v)
	}
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(describe(21))
	fmt.Println(describe("go"))
	fmt.Println(describe(Point{3, 4}))
	fmt.Println(describe(nil))
	fmt.Println(describe(3.14))
}
```
```console
$ go run main.go
an int, doubled: 42
a string of length 2
a point at (3, 4)
some other type: float64
nothing at all
```

*What just happened:* each `case` matched against `x`'s dynamic type - in `int`, `v` was already usable (`v*2` compiled); in `Point`, `v` had real `.X`/`.Y` fields. `nil` caught the empty box, and `default` swept up `float64` (`%T` prints the dynamic type). One switch replaced five separate comma-ok assertions.

## The empty interface and `any` - holds anything, knows nothing

An interface requiring *zero* methods accepts everything, since every type trivially has "no methods at all." That's the **empty interface**, written `interface{}`; since Go 1.18 it has a readable, identical alias: **`any`**.

📝 **`any` / `interface{}`** - an interface with no methods, so every value satisfies it: the universal box. You can put anything in, but call *no* methods on it until you pull the concrete type back out (with an assertion or type switch).

**When it's the right tool.** Genuinely heterogeneous data where you can't know the types ahead of time: decoded JSON (`map[string]any`), `fmt.Println`'s variadic `...any`, a cache storing arbitrary values.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	// A bag of mixed types - the empty interface earns its keep here.
	row := []any{"Ada", 36, true, 3.14}
	for _, field := range row {
		fmt.Printf("%v (%T)\n", field, field)
	}
}
```
```console
$ go run main.go
Ada (string)
36 (int)
true (bool)
3.14 (float64)
```

*What just happened:* `[]any` held a string, an int, a bool, and a float in one slice - impossible with a typed slice. Each element kept its own (type, value) pair, which is why `%T` reported the real type of each - the legitimate use case: data that's *inherently* mixed.

💡 **Prefer a specific interface whenever you can name the behavior you need.** `any` discards type safety - the compiler can't catch a wrong-type mistake, and every use site must assert the type back out. If what you need is "something I can write to" or "something with a `String()` method," declare *that* interface (`io.Writer`, `fmt.Stringer`). Code smell: a function taking `any` and immediately type-switching on known types usually wanted those types as a small interface instead.

## The nil-interface trap, fully explained

Phase 9 named this one and showed the symptom; now you have the model for *why* - one of the most baffling bugs in Go, and it follows directly from the (type, value) pair.

⚠️ **An interface is `nil` only when *both* slots are empty - type *and* value.** If the type slot holds a concrete type, the interface is **not nil**, even with a nil pointer in the value slot. A nil *pointer* and a nil *interface* are not the same thing.

The classic bug: a function returns a `*MyError`, and a nil one accidentally becomes a non-nil `error`.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type MyError struct{ msg string }

func (e *MyError) Error() string { return e.msg }

// BUG: returns the concrete pointer type, even when there's no error.
func doWork(fail bool) error {
	var e *MyError // nil pointer of type *MyError
	if fail {
		e = &MyError{msg: "it broke"}
	}
	return e // <- always wraps *MyError into the error box
}

func main() {
	err := doWork(false) // we expect "no error"
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("caller thinks there was an error:", err)
	} else {
		fmt.Println("no error")
	}
}
```
```console
$ go run main.go
caller thinks there was an error: <nil>
```

*What just happened:* even with `fail == false`, `e` is a nil `*MyError` - but `return e` stuffs it into the `error` interface, filling the **type slot** with `*MyError`. The value slot is nil, the type slot isn't, so `err != nil` is `true` and the caller wrongly concludes work failed. (The printed `<nil>` works only because `.Error()` doesn't dereference `e`; touching `e.msg` would panic instead - either way, the `if` already took the wrong branch.)

The fix: never let a typed nil leak into the interface. Return a *bare* `nil` when there's no error:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type MyError struct{ msg string }

func (e *MyError) Error() string { return e.msg }

// FIXED: return the *interface* nil explicitly when nothing went wrong.
func doWork(fail bool) error {
	if fail {
		return &MyError{msg: "it broke"} // non-nil error, correctly
	}
	return nil // both slots empty -> a true nil error
}

func main() {
	err := doWork(false)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("error:", err)
	} else {
		fmt.Println("no error")
	}
}
```
```console
$ go run main.go
no error
```

*What just happened:* returning the literal `nil` on the happy path hands back an interface with *both* slots empty - a genuine nil `error`, so `err != nil` is `false` and the caller takes the right branch. The rule: don't declare a typed pointer variable and return it as an interface; return concrete errors only when you have one, a bare `nil` otherwise - why idiomatic Go writes `return nil` rather than `return someNilPointer`.

## Recap

1. **An interface value is a (type, value) pair.** The type slot remembers the concrete type; the value slot holds the data. This single fact explains everything else, including dynamic dispatch - the method that runs is chosen from the concrete type in the box.
2. **Type assertions read the type slot.** `v, ok := x.(T)` is the safe comma-ok form; `v := x.(T)` panics on a mismatch. Default to comma-ok unless a panic is the right answer.
3. **A type switch** (`switch v := x.(type)`) branches on the dynamic type and hands you the unwrapped value per case - the clean way to handle several possible types.
4. **`any` (alias for `interface{}`)** accepts every value because it requires no methods. Right for genuinely heterogeneous data (JSON, mixed bags); a smell when a specific named interface would say what you actually need.
5. ⚠️ **The nil trap:** an interface is nil only when *both* slots are empty. A nil `*MyError` returned as `error` fills the type slot, so `err != nil` is true. Return a bare `nil`, never a typed nil pointer.

You now understand interfaces as a small box that pairs behavior with data, not a hierarchy. Next: **generics**, Go's way to write one function or type that works across many concrete types *with* full compile-time type safety.
