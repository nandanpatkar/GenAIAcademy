# The Data Model & Dunder Methods

Back in Phase 6 you met `__init__` and `self`, and learned the word **dunder** - double underscore.
You were told these names are "hooks": you define them, and Python calls them at the right moment.

Here's the secret nobody tells you up front: **Python's built-in syntax is mostly an illusion.**
`len(x)` doesn't come from privileged knowledge of how long things are - it calls `x.__len__()`. `a + b`
calls `a.__add__(b)`. `print(x)` calls `x.__repr__()` or `x.__str__()`. The square brackets, the `+`,
the `==`, the `for` loop - all of it is sugar over method calls on *your* objects. Learn which method
each piece of syntax calls, and your own classes can behave exactly like the built-ins.

This collection of hooks has a name: **the data model**.

## The one rule: syntax dispatches to a dunder method

**What it actually is.** Almost every piece of Python syntax delegates to a corresponding dunder method.
The syntax is the friendly face; the dunder does the work. You never call the dunder yourself - you write
the syntax, and Python calls it on the object involved.

📝 **The data model** - Python's published contract of which dunder each operator, built-in, and piece of
syntax calls. Implement the right dunders and your object plugs into the language as if it were built in.

Here's the dispatch for one example, `len(x)`:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  call["len(x)"] --> dispatch["Python looks up<br/>x.__len__"]
  dispatch --> method["x.__len__()"]
  method --> result["returns an int"]
```

*One idea:* `len()` is a thin wrapper that finds your object's `__len__` method and calls it. The same
shape holds for the rest of the model - find the syntax, find the dunder behind it.

A handful of the most common pairings, so the pattern is concrete:

| You write | Python calls |
|---|---|
| `len(x)` | `x.__len__()` |
| `x[key]` | `x.__getitem__(key)` |
| `a + b` | `a.__add__(b)` |
| `a == b` | `a.__eq__(b)` |
| `print(x)` / `str(x)` | `x.__str__()` |
| `repr(x)` / the REPL echo | `x.__repr__()` |
| `for item in x:` | `x.__iter__()` |
| `x()` | `x.__call__()` |

> 💡 **Key point.** You won't memorize this table, and you don't need to. Hold the *rule* - "syntax calls
> a dunder on the object" - and look up the specific name when you need it.

## `__repr__` vs `__str__` - how your object describes itself

**The problem it solves.** Make a class and print an instance, and you get this:

```python
class Money:
    def __init__(self, cents):
        self.cents = cents

print(Money(500))
```
```console
$ python money.py
<__main__.Money object at 0x10f4c2a90>
```
*What just happened:* Python had no idea how to turn your `Money` into text, so it fell back to its
default: the class name and the object's memory address - useless to anyone reading a log at 2am.

You teach it with two dunders, and the difference between them matters:

📝 **`__repr__`** - the *unambiguous* representation, aimed at a developer. Ideally it looks like the code
that would recreate the object: `Money(500)`. This is what the REPL echoes and what shows up in a list, a
dict, or a debugger.
📝 **`__str__`** - the *readable* representation, aimed at an end user. `print()` and `str()` use it; if
undefined, Python falls back to `__repr__`.

```python runnable
class Money:
    def __init__(self, cents):
        self.cents = cents

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Money({self.cents})"          # looks like the constructor call

    def __str__(self):
        return f"${self.cents / 100:.2f}"      # looks like money

m = Money(500)
print(m)            # uses __str__
print(repr(m))      # uses __repr__
print([m])          # a list shows __repr__ of its contents
```
```console
$ python money.py
$5.00
Money(500)
[Money(500)]
```
*What just happened:* `print(m)` used `__str__` for the human-friendly `$5.00`; `repr(m)` used `__repr__`
for `Money(500)` - readable enough to paste back into code. Collections always show their elements'
`__repr__`, which is why a good one makes debugging calmer: `[Money(500), Money(150)]`, not three memory
addresses.

⚠️ **Gotcha - skipping `__repr__` is a debugging tax you pay forever.** Define nothing, and every log
line, error message, and `print` of a list of your objects shows `<Money object at 0x...>`. **Always give
a class a `__repr__`** - it's the single highest-value dunder. `__str__` is optional (it falls back to
`__repr__`); `__repr__` is the one you owe yourself.

## `__eq__` - what "equal" means for your object (and why it drags `__hash__` along)

**The problem it solves.** By default, two objects are equal only if they're the *same object in memory*
- the `is`-style identity from [Phase 9](09-idioms-and-gotchas.md). You almost never mean that: two
`Money(500)` values are *the same amount of money*, even as separate objects.

`__eq__` lets you define equality by *value* - Python calls it for `==`.

```python runnable
class Money:
    def __init__(self, cents):
        self.cents = cents

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Money({self.cents})"

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.cents == other.cents       # equal when the amounts match

print(Money(500) == Money(500))    # same amount
print(Money(500) == Money(150))    # different amount
```
```console
$ python eq.py
True
False
```
*What just happened:* `Money(500) == Money(500)` is now `True` even though they're two distinct objects,
because your `__eq__` compares `cents` instead of identity.

But you just broke something quietly: the moment you define `__eq__`, Python *removes* the default
`__hash__`, so your objects become unhashable - they can't go in a `set` or be used as `dict` keys:

```python
amounts = {Money(500), Money(150)}
```
```console
$ python eq.py
TypeError: unhashable type: 'Money'
```
*What just happened:* Python requires that anything used as a set member or dict key have a `__hash__`,
and **objects that are equal must have the same hash**. Redefine equality but leave the old hash in
place and that promise could break - so Python disables hashing until you say what it should be.

📝 **`__hash__`** - returns an integer Python uses to bucket the object in sets and dicts. The contract: if
`a == b`, then `hash(a) == hash(b)`. Honor it by hashing the same data your `__eq__` compares - usually as
a tuple.

```python runnable
class Money:
    def __init__(self, cents):
        self.cents = cents

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Money({self.cents})"

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.cents == other.cents

    def __hash__(self):
        return hash(self.cents)        # hash the SAME data __eq__ compares

amounts = {Money(500), Money(500), Money(150)}
print(amounts)                          # the two equal 500s collapse into one
```
```console
$ python eq.py
{Money(500), Money(150)}
```
*What just happened:* With `__hash__` mirroring `__eq__`, `Money` works in a `set` again - since the two
`Money(500)` objects are equal *and* hash the same, the set treats them as one. The rule: **define
`__eq__` and `__hash__` together, over the same fields, or not at all.**

⚠️ **Gotcha - `__eq__` without `__hash__` silently costs you sets and dicts.** The `TypeError` only fires
when you actually try to put the object in a set or use it as a key, possibly far from where you wrote
`__eq__`. If your "value" object should be usable as a key (most should), add `__hash__` in the same
edit. (Exception: *mutable* objects you intend to change in place are often left deliberately unhashable,
since their hash would shift underneath the set.)

## `__getitem__` and `__iter__` - making an object indexable and loopable

The data model is what makes `x[key]` and `for item in x:` work on the built-in types, and you can opt
your own classes in.

**`__getitem__` - square brackets.** Define it, and `x[key]` calls `x.__getitem__(key)`. `key` can be
anything - an integer, a string, a slice - it's your method, you decide what it means.

```python runnable
class Playlist:
    def __init__(self, songs):
        self.songs = songs

    def __getitem__(self, index):
        return self.songs[index]        # delegate to the underlying list

p = Playlist(["Intro", "Verse", "Chorus"])
print(p[0])         # calls p.__getitem__(0)
print(p[-1])        # negative indexing, for free
```
```console
$ python playlist.py
Intro
Chorus
```
*What just happened:* `p[0]` dispatched to your `__getitem__`, which handed the work to the inner list.
You didn't subclass `list` - you implemented one hook and `Playlist` started behaving like a sequence.

**`__iter__` - the `for` loop.** When you write `for song in p:`, Python calls `p.__iter__()` to get an
**iterator**, then pulls items from it one at a time. Returning `iter(self.songs)` borrows the list's own
iterator - the simplest correct move:

```python runnable
class Playlist:
    def __init__(self, songs):
        self.songs = songs

    def __iter__(self):
        return iter(self.songs)         # hand back the list's iterator

p = Playlist(["Intro", "Verse", "Chorus"])
for song in p:
    print(song)
```
```console
$ python playlist.py
Intro
Verse
Chorus
```
*What just happened:* `for song in p:` called `p.__iter__()`, got the list's iterator back, and walked it.
Your object is now loopable. This is the *shallow* end of iteration - enough to make a class work in a
`for` loop today. The real machinery (what an iterator actually is, `__next__`, and how to write your own,
including ones that generate values lazily) is the whole of
[Iterators & Generators](11-iterators-and-generators.md).

## Operator overloading - teaching `+` to your type

**What it actually is.** **Operator overloading** is the data-model rule applied to math symbols: `a + b`
calls `a.__add__(b)`, `a - b` calls `a.__sub__(b)`, and so on. The operators carry no built-in knowledge
of *your* type; you supply the meaning by defining the dunder.

Combine this with the `__repr__` and `__eq__` from before and `Money` becomes a small, complete value
type:

```python runnable
class Money:
    def __init__(self, cents):
        self.cents = cents

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Money({self.cents})"

    def __str__(self):
        return f"${self.cents / 100:.2f}"

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.cents == other.cents

    def __hash__(self):
        return hash(self.cents)

    def __add__(self, other):           # called for  self + other
        return Money(self.cents + other.cents)

    def __mul__(self, factor):          # called for  self * factor
        return Money(self.cents * factor)

price = Money(500)
tax = Money(45)
total = price + tax                     # __add__
doubled = price * 2                     # __mul__
print(total)
print(doubled)
print(total == Money(545))
```
```console
$ python money.py
$5.45
$10.00
True
```
*What just happened:* `price + tax` dispatched to `__add__`, which returned a *new* `Money` of 545 cents.
`price * 2` dispatched to `__mul__`. Then `total == Money(545)` used `__eq__`. `Money` now reads exactly
like a built-in number type - `+`, `*`, `==`, a clean `print` - but every behavior is a method you wrote.
That's the payoff of the data model: **your types become first-class citizens of the language.**

📝 **Return a new object, don't mutate.** `__add__` returns a fresh `Money` rather than changing `self` -
mirroring how `+` works everywhere in Python (`3 + 4` doesn't change `3`) and keeping your type
predictable. Operators that quietly mutate their operands surprise everyone who uses them.

> 🪖 **War story.** A teammate built a `Vector` class for a physics sim and made `+` mutate the left-hand
> vector in place to "save an allocation." A week later, positions were drifting - `total = a + b` was
> silently corrupting `a` every frame. The fix was one line: return a new `Vector`. Operators are expected
> to be pure; honor the reader's intuition over the micro-optimization.

## Recap

1. **The data model is one rule:** syntax dispatches to a dunder on the object. `len(x)` → `x.__len__()`,
   `a + b` → `a.__add__(b)`, `x[k]` → `x.__getitem__(k)`. Learn the rule, look up the name.
2. **`__repr__` vs `__str__`:** `__repr__` is the unambiguous, developer-facing form (also what lists and
   the REPL show); `__str__` is the readable form `print` uses. **Always define `__repr__`** - skipping it
   gives you the useless `<object at 0x...>` in every log.
3. **`__eq__` defines value equality** (`==`), but makes your object **unhashable** until you add
   **`__hash__`** - define the two together over the same fields, or sets and dicts break.
4. **`__getitem__`** makes `x[key]` work; **`__iter__`** makes `for item in x:` work. (The deep version of
   iteration is next.)
5. **Operator overloading** is the same rule for symbols: define `__add__`, `__mul__`, etc. Return *new*
   objects; don't mutate operands.

You can now make your own classes behave like Python's built-ins. `__iter__` was touched only lightly -
iteration is deep enough, and useful enough, to deserve its own phase. Next: what an iterator really is,
and how generators produce values lazily, one at a time, without building the whole sequence in memory.
