# Iterators & Generators

You've written `for line in file:` and `for x in my_list:` since Phase 2, and it just worked. But what is
the `for` loop actually *doing*? And what happens when a list gets so big it eats all your RAM? This phase
answers both, and the idea connecting them is one of the most useful in Python.

That idea is **laziness**: producing values *one at a time, on demand*, instead of building the whole
collection up front. A list of a billion numbers needs a billion numbers' worth of memory. A *lazy*
sequence of a billion numbers needs room for one. Once that clicks, you can process a 10 GB file on a
laptop, or loop over an *infinite* sequence without your machine catching fire.

## The iterator protocol - what a `for` loop really does

**What it actually is.** An **iterable** is anything you can loop over (a list, a string, a file, a dict).
An **iterator** actually walks through it, handing you one item at a time and remembering where it left
off. Two roles: the iterable is the book; the iterator is the bookmark.

📝 **Iterable** - something you *can* loop over (has `__iter__`). **Iterator** - the stateful walker that
produces items one by one (has `__next__`). `for` asks the iterable for a fresh iterator, then pulls
items until they run out.

Writing `for x in things:` makes Python do three things under the hood:

1. Calls `iter(things)` to get an iterator (this runs `things.__iter__()`).
2. Calls `next(...)` on that iterator over and over to get each value (this runs `__next__()`).
3. Stops when `__next__` raises a special exception, `StopIteration`, which means "nothing left."

```mermaid

  A[for x in things] --> B["iter(things)<br/>__iter__"]
  B --> C["next(it)<br/>__next__"]
  C -->|value| D[run loop body]
  D --> C
  C -->|StopIteration| E[loop ends]
```

*One idea:* the `for` loop is an automatic `next()`-calling machine. It keeps asking for the next value
and stops the moment the iterator signals it's empty.

**A real example.** Drive that machinery by hand to see it move:

```python runnable
things = ["a", "b"]
it = iter(things)          # get an iterator (the bookmark)

print(next(it))            # pull the first item
print(next(it))            # pull the second
try:
    print(next(it))        # nothing left...
except StopIteration:
    print("done - StopIteration raised")
```
```console
$ python protocol.py
a
b
done - StopIteration raised
```
*What just happened:* `iter(things)` made an iterator that remembers its position. Each `next(it)` advanced
it by one and returned that item. The third `next(it)` found nothing left and raised `StopIteration` - the
signal a `for` loop catches to know it's time to stop. A `for` loop is just this, with the `try/except`
handled for you.

**Why this saves you later.** Once you know `for` is "call `next` until `StopIteration`," a pile of Python
behavior stops being mysterious: why a file object can be looped but not indexed, why you can't rewind a
loop mid-stream, and how generators plug straight into every `for` loop you'll write.

## Generators - a function that pauses and resumes

Writing a class with `__iter__` and `__next__` to produce a sequence is a lot of ceremony. Python's easier
way to make an iterator is the **generator**.

**What it actually is.** A **generator** is a function that uses `yield` instead of `return`. The moment a
function contains `yield`, calling it doesn't run the body - it hands back an iterator. Each time
something pulls a value, the function runs until the next `yield`, hands that value out, then **freezes
right there**, remembering all its local variables. The next pull thaws it and continues from that spot.

📝 **`yield`** - like `return`, but instead of ending the function, it pauses it and produces one value.
The function picks up where it left off on the next request. A function with `yield` in it is a generator.

**Why this exists.** `return` ends a function and throws away everything it knew. `yield` produces a value
*without* ending, so a single function can produce a whole stream over time, keeping its place between
values - exactly the "one item at a time, remember where you were" behavior the iterator protocol wants.

**A real example.** Watch the pausing happen:

```python runnable
def count_to_three():
    print("  -> starting")
    yield 1
    print("  -> resumed after 1")
    yield 2
    print("  -> resumed after 2")
    yield 3

for n in count_to_three():
    print("got", n)
```
```console
$ python gen.py
  -> starting
got 1
  -> resumed after 1
got 2
  -> resumed after 2
got 3
```
*What just happened:* Calling `count_to_three()` ran *none* of the body - it returned a generator. The
`for` loop pulled the first value, running the function to `yield 1` before it froze. Pulling again thawed
it right after that `yield`, ran to `yield 2`, and froze again. The interleaved prints prove the function
is genuinely pausing and resuming, not running all at once.

**The gotcha - a generator is single-use.** A generator is an iterator, and an iterator gets *consumed*:
once you've walked to the end, it's empty forever.

```python runnable
def squares():
    for n in range(3):
        yield n * n

gen = squares()
print("first pass: ", list(gen))   # drains it
print("second pass:", list(gen))   # already empty
```
```console
$ python single_use.py
first pass:  [0, 1, 4]
second pass: []
```
*What just happened:* The first `list(gen)` pulled every value until `StopIteration`, exhausting the
generator. The second `list(gen)` started where the first left off - at the end - so it got an empty list.
This trips people in sneaky ways: passing a generator to a function that loops over it twice, or printing
it for debugging (which drains it) before the real loop runs.

⚠️ **Fix:** if you need to iterate twice, call the generator function again for a *fresh* one
(`squares()`), or materialize it once into a list - but only if the data fits in memory, the very thing
generators exist to avoid.

## Generator expressions - comprehensions that don't build the list

You met list comprehensions in [Phase 9](09-idioms-and-gotchas.md): `[x*x for x in nums]` builds a whole
list. Swap the square brackets for parentheses and you get a **generator expression** - same syntax, but
*lazy*: it produces values one at a time and never holds the full result in memory.

**What it actually is.** `(x*x for x in nums)` is a generator written inline, computing each value only
when asked. The difference from `[x*x for x in nums]` isn't the output values - it's *when* and *whether*
they all exist at once.

```python runnable
import sys

list_comp = [x * x for x in range(10000)]    # builds all 10,000 now
gen_expr  = (x * x for x in range(10000))    # builds nothing yet

print("list comp bytes:", sys.getsizeof(list_comp))
print("gen expr bytes: ", sys.getsizeof(gen_expr))
print("first three:", next(gen_expr), next(gen_expr), next(gen_expr))
```
```console
$ python genexpr.py
list comp bytes: 85176
gen expr bytes:  208
first three: 0 1 4
```
*What just happened:* The list comprehension allocated all 10,000 squares immediately - tens of kilobytes,
growing with the input. The generator expression allocated a tiny fixed-size object holding *the recipe*,
not the results: `208` bytes whether the range is 10,000 or 10 billion. The squares only come into being
as `next()` asks for them. (Sizes are from CPython on a 64-bit build and vary by platform, but the lesson
- fixed-and-tiny vs. grows-with-input - holds everywhere.)

💡 **Key point.** Use a **list** comprehension when you need the whole collection in hand (to index it,
loop twice, or pass it around). Use a **generator** expression when you'll consume the values once, in a
single pass - especially if the input is huge. Rule of thumb: if it feeds straight into a `for`, `sum()`,
`any()`, or `min()`, a generator expression is usually leaner.

## Why it matters - huge files and infinite sequences

Here's where laziness stops being a curiosity and starts saving your program.

**Process a file bigger than your RAM.** A file object is *already* a lazy iterator over its lines -
looping it reads one line at a time, never the whole file. Wrap that in your own generator to build a
processing pipeline that stays small no matter the file size:

```python runnable
import io

# Pretend this is a 10 GB log file; io.StringIO behaves like an open file.
fake_file = io.StringIO("error: disk full\ninfo: started\nerror: timeout\n")

def error_lines(f):
    for line in f:                 # one line at a time - never the whole file
        if line.startswith("error"):
            yield line.rstrip()

for line in error_lines(fake_file):
    print(line)
```
```console
$ python bigfile.py
error: disk full
error: timeout
```
*What just happened:* `error_lines` is a generator. It pulls one line from the file, and if it's an error,
yields it - then pauses until the next line is needed. At no point does the whole file (or the whole list
of error lines) sit in memory. Point this at a real 10 GB log opened with `open(path)` and it uses the same
tiny footprint, one line at a time, start to finish. That's the headline use case for generators.

**Loop over something infinite.** A list can't be infinite - you can't store endless items. A generator
can *describe* an endless sequence and produce it on demand. You just need a way to stop pulling.

```python runnable
def naturals():
    n = 0
    while True:        # never ends on its own
        yield n
        n += 1

gen = naturals()
first_five = [next(gen) for _ in range(5)]   # pull exactly 5, then stop asking
print(first_five)
```
```console
$ python infinite.py
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```
*What just happened:* `naturals()` would yield numbers forever if you let it - the `while True` never
finishes. But nothing is computed until you ask, so you pulled exactly five values with `next()` and
walked away. The generator is paused mid-`while`, holding `n`, ready to continue if you come back.
⚠️ Never write a bare `for x in naturals():` with no stopping condition - it runs until you kill the
process. You need something that caps how many values you pull, which is what `itertools` gives you.

## A peek at `itertools` - the lazy toolkit

The standard library's `itertools` module is a box of ready-made lazy building blocks. They take iterators
and produce iterators without materializing anything. Three you'll reach for constantly:

- **`count(start)`** - counts upward forever (a lazy, infinite `range`).
- **`islice(it, n)`** - takes the first `n` items from any iterator, then stops. Your "stop pulling" tool
  for infinite generators.
- **`chain(a, b)`** - glues iterables end to end into one stream, without copying them into a combined list.

```python runnable
from itertools import count, islice, chain

# islice tames an infinite counter: take 5, no manual next() loop
first_five = list(islice(count(0), 5))
print(first_five)

# chain walks two sequences as one, lazily
for x in chain([1, 2], ["a", "b"]):
    print(x)
```
```console
$ python itertools_demo.py
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
1
2
a
b
```
*What just happened:* `count(0)` is an endless lazy counter; `islice(count(0), 5)` pulled exactly the
first five values and raised `StopIteration`, so `list(...)` got `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` and the counter never
ran away. `chain([1, 2], ["a", "b"])` produced all four items as a single stream without building a
combined `[1, 2, "a", "b"]` list. Same pattern throughout: take iterators, return iterators, stay lazy.

## Recap

1. A `for` loop calls `iter()` to get an **iterator**, then `next()` until it raises **`StopIteration`**.
   That's the whole **iterator protocol**.
2. A **generator** is a function with **`yield`**: it pauses and resumes, producing a stream of values one
   at a time while remembering its place.
3. A **generator expression** `(x*x for x in ...)` is a lazy comprehension - same syntax as `[...]`, but it
   never builds the full list, so its memory stays tiny no matter the input size.
4. Laziness is the payoff: **process a 10 GB file or an infinite sequence** without loading it into RAM,
   one item at a time.
5. ⚠️ A generator is **single-use** - once exhausted, it's empty. Make a fresh one (or a list) if you need
   to iterate again.
6. **`itertools`** (`count`, `islice`, `chain`) gives you lazy building blocks; `islice` is how you safely
   take a finite slice of an infinite generator.

You can now produce values without paying for all of them up front. Next: **decorators** - wrapping a
function in extra behavior without touching its body, built on the same "functions are just objects" idea
that makes generators tick.
