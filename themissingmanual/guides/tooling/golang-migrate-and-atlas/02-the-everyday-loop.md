# The everyday loop

The mental model is set. Now the muscle memory. The daily rhythm with both tools is the same shape - create a change, apply it, sometimes undo it - but the commands and the feel are different. We'll do golang-migrate first because it maps directly to the imperative model, then Atlas in both its versioned and declarative modes.

Throughout, the connection string is a URL. For golang-migrate's CLI you'll often set it once:

```bash
export DATABASE_URL="postgres://app:secret@localhost:5432/app?sslmode=disable"
```

*What just happened:* you put the database location in one place so the commands below stay short. Both tools read connection details from a URL like this; the scheme (`postgres://`, `mysql://`, `sqlite://`) tells them which driver to use.

## golang-migrate: create

A migration is a numbered pair of files. The CLI scaffolds both:

```console
$ migrate create -ext sql -dir migrations -seq add_users_table
.../migrations/000001_add_users_table.up.sql
.../migrations/000001_add_users_table.down.sql
```

*What just happened:* `-seq` gave you zero-padded sequential numbers (`000001`) instead of a timestamp - a clean, readable order. `-ext sql` set the file extension; `-dir` chose where they land. You now have two empty files to fill in.

Fill them in with the change and its reversal:

```sql
-- 000001_add_users_table.up.sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id    BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE
);

-- 000001_add_users_table.down.sql
DROP TABLE users;
```

## golang-migrate: apply and roll back

```console
$ migrate -database "$DATABASE_URL" -path migrations up
1/u add_users_table (18.4ms)
```

*What just happened:* golang-migrate looked at its bookkeeping table (`schema_migrations`) in your database, saw version 0, and ran every `up` file after that in order - here, only migration 1. It then recorded the new current version as 1. Run it again and nothing happens, because there's nothing newer.

To undo, you step *down* by a count:

```console
$ migrate -database "$DATABASE_URL" -path migrations down 1
1/d add_users_table (12.1ms)
```

*What just happened:* `down 1` ran exactly one `down` file - the most recent applied migration's reversal - and rolled the recorded version back to 0. Plain `down` with no number rolls back *everything*, which is rarely what you want; always pass a count.

You can also jump to a specific version or check where you are:

```console
$ migrate -database "$DATABASE_URL" -path migrations version
1
$ migrate -database "$DATABASE_URL" -path migrations goto 1
```

*What just happened:* `version` printed the current recorded version; `goto N` migrated up or down as needed to land exactly on version N. This is the imperative model in action - everything keys off that integer counter.

## golang-migrate: from Go code

The same migrations can run from inside your service at startup, which many teams prefer over a separate CLI step. The library embeds the files and applies them:

```go
import (
    "github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4"
    _ "github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4/database/postgres"
    _ "github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4/source/file"
)

m, err := migrate.New("file://migrations", databaseURL)
if err != nil { log.Fatal(err) }
if err := m.Up(); err != nil && err != migrate.ErrNoChange {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
```

*What just happened:* `m.Up()` did exactly what the CLI's `up` did, from inside your program. The two blank imports register the Postgres driver and the file source - golang-migrate's drivers are opt-in, so you import only what you use. Note the `ErrNoChange` check: when there's nothing new to apply, `Up()` returns that sentinel error, and treating it as fatal would crash every clean boot.

## Atlas: versioned mode (the familiar shape)

Atlas can work like golang-migrate - generating versioned files you commit - but with a twist: it can *author the SQL for you* by diffing your desired schema against the migration history.

You keep a desired-state file and ask Atlas for the next migration:

```console
$ atlas migrate diff add_users_table \
    --dir "file://migrations" \
    --to "file://schema.sql" \
    --dev-url "docker://postgres/16/dev"
Generated migrations/20260630090000_add_users_table.sql
```

*What just happened:* Atlas replayed your existing migrations onto a throwaway dev database (`--dev-url`), compared the result against `schema.sql`, and *wrote the SQL for the difference* into a new timestamped migration file. You get a versioned, committable file like golang-migrate, but you didn't hand-write the `CREATE TABLE` - you edited the desired schema and Atlas produced the step. Applying it is then ordinary:

```console
$ atlas migrate apply \
    --dir "file://migrations" \
    --url "$DATABASE_URL"
Migrating to version 20260630090000 (1 migration in total):
  -- migrating version 20260630090000
    -> CREATE TABLE users (...);
  -- ok (9.2ms)
```

*What just happened:* Atlas applied the pending versioned files in order and recorded them in its own tracking table (`atlas_schema_revisions`). Same destination as golang-migrate's `up`, reached through generated rather than hand-written SQL.

## Atlas: declarative mode (skip the files)

In declarative mode there are no migration files at all. You keep only the desired schema and let Atlas reconcile reality to it:

```console
$ atlas schema apply \
    --url "$DATABASE_URL" \
    --to "file://schema.sql" \
    --dev-url "docker://postgres/16/dev"
-- Planned Changes:
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now();
Apply changes? [y/N] y
```

*What just happened:* you added one line to `schema.sql` (a `created_at` column), and Atlas computed the single `ALTER TABLE` needed to make the live database match. There's no migration file to write or name - the schema file *is* the source of truth. The `[y/N]` prompt is the safety gate: you read the plan, then approve. In CI you'd pass `--auto-approve`, but only after a separate review of the plan.

> Pick one mode per project and commit. Mixing hand-edited golang-migrate files with Atlas declarative apply against the same database is how you get two tools fighting over the same schema and neither one trusting its own bookkeeping.

## In the wild

A common, sane setup: **Atlas versioned mode** as the team default - you edit a desired schema, Atlas generates reviewable SQL files, and those files apply identically in CI and prod. You get the readability of declarative *authoring* with the audit trail and predictability of committed versioned files. Pure declarative `schema apply` shines for prototyping and internal tools where the schema file as single source of truth is worth more than a file-by-file history. golang-migrate stays the lean choice when you want zero magic - every line of SQL is one you wrote and can point to.

    "choices": [
      "Because Up() always fails the first time",
