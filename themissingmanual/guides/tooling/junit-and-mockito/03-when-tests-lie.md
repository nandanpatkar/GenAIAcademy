# When tests lie

Here's the uncomfortable truth about a green test suite: passing tests prove your *tests* pass, not that your *code is correct*. Mockito makes this especially easy to get wrong, because a mock does exactly what you told it to - including agreeing with bugs. This phase is the set of failure modes that turn a test suite from a safety net into a wall of false confidence, and how to spot them before they cost you a production incident.

## The mock-too-much trap

This is the big one. When you mock every collaborator, your test stops describing reality and starts describing your *assumptions* about reality. If your assumption is wrong, the mock is wrong, and the test passes anyway.

```java
@Test
void calculatesDiscount() {
    // mocking the thing we're supposedly testing the math of
    when(pricingRules.discountFor(customer)).thenReturn(0.20);

    BigDecimal total = checkout.total(customer, items);

    verify(pricingRules).discountFor(customer);
    // ...but did the discount actually get APPLIED to the total? Untested.
}
```

*What just happened:* this test stubs the discount, then verifies the stub was *called* - but it never checks that the discount changed the total. If `checkout.total` fetches the discount and then ignores it, this test stays green while the customer gets charged full price. The mock answered the phone; nobody checked what was done with the answer. The fix is to assert on the real output (`assertEquals(new BigDecimal("80.00"), total)`), not on the fact that a collaborator was consulted.

The deeper rule: **don't mock the thing you're testing, and don't mock value objects you could build yourself.** If `pricingRules` is simple enough to instantiate with real data, use the real one. Mock the things that are slow, non-deterministic, or have side effects - the database, the clock, the payment gateway - not the things that are pure logic.

## Brittle verification: testing how, not what

Over-verification couples your test to the *implementation* instead of the *behavior*. Then a harmless refactor - same result, different internal calls - turns your suite red for no real reason.

```java
// brittle: asserts the exact sequence of internal calls
InOrder order = inOrder(cache, repository);
order.verify(cache).get("user:1");
order.verify(repository).findById(1L);
order.verify(cache).put("user:1", user);
```

*What just happened:* this locks in three calls in a specific order. The moment someone reorders the cache write, adds a metrics call, or swaps the caching strategy, this test fails - even though `getUser(1)` still returns the right user. The test is now an obstacle to good changes. Unless the *ordering itself is the contract* (rare, but real for things like "lock before write"), verify the outcome and skip the choreography.

A test that breaks every time you refactor working code isn't protecting you - it's taxing you. The signal of a healthy mock-based test: you can rewrite the method's internals freely, and as long as the behavior is unchanged, the test stays green.

## NullPointerException from an unstubbed mock

A mock returns "empty" defaults for anything you didn't stub - `null` for objects, `false` for booleans, `0` for numbers. That `null` is a landmine.

```java
@Test
void greetsUser() {
    // forgot to stub findById, so it returns Optional... no, plain null
    User user = userService.load(1L);   // NPE inside load()
    assertEquals("Alice", user.name());
}
```

*What just happened:* `findById` was never stubbed, so the mock returned `null`, and `load` exploded trying to use it. The error points *inside your production code*, so it looks like a bug there - but the real cause is a missing stub in the test. When a mock-based test throws an unexpected NPE, your first suspect should be an un-stubbed collaborator returning `null`, not a flaw in the code under test.

## Static, time, and the things mocks can't reach cleanly

Plenty of code reaches for `LocalDateTime.now()`, `Math.random()`, or a static factory deep in a method. Mockito can mock statics now (`mockStatic`), but reaching for it is often a smell - it usually means the dependency wasn't injected and should have been.

```java
// hard to test: time is grabbed internally
public boolean isExpired() {
    return expiry.isBefore(LocalDateTime.now());   // now() is uncontrollable
}

// testable: time comes in as a Clock you can fix in a test
public boolean isExpired(Clock clock) {
    return expiry.isBefore(LocalDateTime.now(clock));
}
```

*What just happened:* the first version bakes "now" into the method, so a test can't pin time down and can't reliably check the boundary. The second takes a `Clock`, and a test passes `Clock.fixed(...)` to make "now" deterministic. The lesson generalizes: when something is painful to test, the design - not the test tool - is usually telling you to inject the dependency instead of grabbing it.

> **In the wild:** the most valuable thing a mature team does is keep a few **un-mocked** tests that wire real objects together and only fake the true edges (DB, network, clock). Heavily-mocked unit tests verify each part in isolation; a handful of integration tests catch the wiring bugs that mocks define away. You want both, weighted toward the cheap unit tests but never zero of the integration ones.

## A quick gut-check before you commit a test

- Does it assert on a real **output**, or only that a collaborator was *called*?
- Would it survive a refactor that keeps behavior identical?
- Are you mocking slow/external things, or also mocking plain logic you could run for real?
- If it passes, would a genuine bug in this method make it fail? (If not, it's decoration.)
