# Why an Agent in Your Terminal

Picture the old way. You're stuck on something - a script that won't run, a config you don't understand. You open a chat window, describe the problem as best you can, maybe paste in a chunk of code. The AI gives you a fix. Now you copy it, switch back to your editor, find the right spot, paste it in, fix the indentation, run it, find out it referenced a file that doesn't exist in your project, switch back to the chat, explain that, get a new version, and repeat.

The chatbot is smart but blind. It can't see your project. It doesn't know your file names, your folder layout, what version of anything you have installed, or what error your terminal actually printed. You are the messenger, carrying context back and forth by hand. Most of the friction isn't the thinking - it's the ferrying.

A terminal agent removes the ferrying. You run it from inside your project folder, and it can look around for itself.

## What "it can act" really means

When people say a terminal agent can "act," they mean three concrete things:

- **It can read your files.** It opens the files in your project and reads them the way you would, so its suggestions fit your actual code instead of a generic template.
- **It can run commands.** It can run your tests, install a package, search the codebase, check what's installed, or reproduce the error you described - and then read the output and react to it.
- **It can edit code.** It can change files directly, not hand you a snippet to paste. You see exactly what it changed before anything is final.

That third one is the leap. The agent doesn't only describe a fix; it makes the change, runs the thing to check it worked, sees the real result, and adjusts. That's a loop a chatbot can't close on its own, because the chatbot never gets to see what happened next.

Here's the same stuck-script scenario with an agent:

```text
You:   This script crashes when I run it. Can you fix it?
Agent: Reading run.py... I see it reads from data/input.csv.
       Running it to reproduce the error...
       It's failing because the file path is relative and you're
       running from a different folder. I'll make the path absolute.
       [shows you the one-line change]
       Re-running... it works now.
```

No copy-paste. No re-explaining your folder layout. It found the real cause by running the thing, not by guessing.

## Why the terminal, specifically

You might wonder why the terminal and not a nice graphical app. A few reasons, and they're practical rather than ideological.

The terminal is where your project already lives. Your files, your version control, your test commands, your package manager - they all run there. An agent that lives in the same place doesn't need a bridge to reach any of it.

It's also honest about what's happening. Every command the agent wants to run shows up as text you can read before it runs. There's no hidden machinery. You can watch it work the same way you'd watch over a colleague's shoulder.

And it's composable. The terminal is built for tools that chain together and run in scripts. Once you're comfortable, you can hand the agent a task and have it run as part of a larger process. (Plenty of these agents also offer editor extensions and graphical versions - but the terminal is the common denominator, and it's where the model is clearest about its actions.)

## The mental model to carry forward

Stop thinking of it as a smarter search box. Start thinking of it as a fast, eager junior colleague who happens to be sitting at your machine.

A junior colleague is genuinely useful. They can do a lot of legwork quickly. But you wouldn't let one push changes to your project without looking. They sometimes misunderstand the goal. They sometimes do the wrong thing confidently. They occasionally break something while trying to fix something else. None of that makes them useless - it only means you stay in the loop, you review their work, and you keep the authority to say "no, not like that."

That's the whole posture for working with a terminal agent: delegate the legwork, keep the judgment. It can read, run, and edit - but it does those things on your say-so, and you're the one who decides what's good enough to keep.

The next phase walks through exactly how that back-and-forth goes in a normal session: how you describe a task, how you watch it work, how you review what changed, and how the permission settings let you tune how much rope it gets before it has to stop and ask.
