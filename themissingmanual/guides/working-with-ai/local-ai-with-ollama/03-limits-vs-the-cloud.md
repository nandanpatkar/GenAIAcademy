# Limits vs the Cloud

A local model is a real win in the right spot. But it is not a free lunch, and pretending otherwise sets you up to be disappointed. The honest picture: the model running on your laptop is smaller, slower, and more forgetful than the frontier models the big labs serve from their data centers. Here is each gap, why it exists, and when it actually matters.

## Quality: smaller models, smaller skill

The biggest cloud models are enormous - far larger than anything that fits on a personal computer. Size is not everything, but in these models it tracks closely with skill: bigger models reason better, follow instructions more reliably, make fewer mistakes, and handle weird edge cases with more grace.

The model you run at home is a fraction of that size, because it has to fit in your memory. So it is genuinely less capable. On a casual question - "rewrite this email to sound warmer" - you may not notice. On something hard - a tricky bit of code, a nuanced legal question, multi-step reasoning, anything where being wrong is expensive - the gap shows. A local model is more likely to be confidently wrong, miss a subtlety, or wander off the instruction.

This is not a knock on local models; it is physics and economics. You cannot fit a data center's model in a laptop. Set your expectations to "a capable junior who is fast and private" rather than "the sharpest expert available."

## Speed: depends entirely on your machine

Cloud providers run racks of specialized hardware, so responses stream back quickly and consistently. Your local speed depends on what is under your desk. With a good GPU, a small model feels snappy. Without one, you watch words trickle out, and a long answer can take a genuinely uncomfortable while.

There is also no scaling. A cloud service can answer ten of your requests at once. Your machine does one thing at a time and gets warm doing it. For interactive back-and-forth that is fine; for "process these 500 documents right now," it will be a long, patient afternoon.

## Context: how much it can read at once

Every model has a limit on how much text it can hold in mind at one time - the "context window." Cloud models keep pushing this higher; some can read a whole book, a large codebase, or hundreds of pages of documents in a single go.

Local models have context windows too, but running with a large one eats a lot of memory - the same memory the model already needs to exist. So in practice you often run a local model with a smaller window than its cloud cousins. That means feeding it a giant contract or an entire repository may not fit, or may force you to chop the input into pieces. For short prompts this never comes up. For "read all of this and reason across it," it is a real constraint.

## A quick comparison

| | Local model (Ollama) | Frontier cloud model |
|---|---|---|
| Quality on hard tasks | Good, not best | Best available |
| Speed | Depends on your hardware | Fast and consistent |
| Context (how much it reads) | Often smaller | Very large |
| Privacy | Total - nothing leaves | Depends on the provider |
| Cost per use | Free after hardware | Per request |
| Works offline | Yes | No |

## So which do you reach for?

A clean rule:

**Use a local model when the deciding factor is privacy, cost at scale, or being offline** - and the task is within reach of a smaller model. Drafting, summarizing, rewriting, tagging, answering routine questions, working through sensitive text, grinding high-volume jobs you do not want metered. For these, local is not a compromise; it is the better tool.

**Reach for a frontier cloud model when the deciding factor is getting it right** - the hard problem, the long document, the answer you will act on without double-checking, the multi-step reasoning where a subtle mistake costs you. When quality is the whole point and the text is not sensitive, pay for the best.

Plenty of people run both, and that is the mature setup. Local for the private, the routine, and the offline; cloud for the hard and the high-stakes. You are not picking a side - you are matching the tool to the job. Start a sensitive draft locally, and if you hit a wall the small model cannot climb, move the non-sensitive parts to the cloud for the final pass.

The thing to carry away: local AI is not a worse version of cloud AI. It is a different deal - you trade some quality, speed, and reach for privacy, zero per-use cost, and independence from the network. Knowing which of those you need on a given task is the whole skill. Now you have both tools, and you know when each one earns its keep.
