# Why Run a Model Yourself

You already have ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini - fast, smart, always available. So why would you run a model on your own laptop, where it is slower and not as sharp? Four reasons, and they are real ones. But they do not apply to everyone, so let's be honest about who this is for.

## Privacy: nothing leaves the machine

When you use a cloud model, your prompt travels to a company's servers. Reputable providers have privacy policies, enterprise tiers that promise not to train on your data, and security teams. For most chats, that is fine.

But some text you would rather not send anywhere. A draft of an unannounced product. A contract with a client's name in it. Notes from a therapy session. Medical history. A founder's cap table. With a local model, none of that crosses the network. The text goes from your keyboard to a model running a few inches away and back. No server logs, no policy to trust, no breach that could expose it. For regulated work - health, legal, finance - that difference can be the whole reason local AI exists.

This is the strongest argument, and it is concrete. "Private" here is not a marketing word; it is a fact about where the bytes go.

## No per-use cost

Cloud models charge by usage. For light use, the bill is small. But if you run thousands of requests - summarizing a folder of documents, tagging a backlog, generating draft after draft - the meter adds up, and you watch it the whole time.

A local model has no meter. You pay once, in hardware and electricity, and then every request is free. If your work involves grinding through volume - and you do not need top-tier quality on each one - running it yourself can turn a recurring bill into a fixed cost you already paid for.

## Offline: works with no internet

A local model needs no connection. On a flight, in a cabin, on bad hotel Wi-Fi, during an outage - it still answers. The model lives on your disk. If your laptop boots, the model runs.

This matters more than it sounds. Cloud AI quietly assumes you are always online. The moment you are not, it is a dead box. A local model is the one that still works when nothing else does.

## Tinkering: it's yours to poke at

The last reason is curiosity. A local model is something you control end to end. You can swap models, try a smaller or larger one, point your own scripts at it, build a little tool over a weekend, and learn how these things behave when you can see all the dials. For the technically curious, that is its own payoff - you understand AI better when one is sitting on your machine instead of behind a paywall.

## Who it's for - and who it isn't

Local AI is a good fit if you:

- Handle sensitive text you would rather not send to a third party.
- Run high volume and want to stop paying per request.
- Work offline often, or need AI that does not depend on a connection.
- Like to experiment and own your stack.

It is a poor fit if you:

- Want the single best answer every time. Frontier cloud models are still sharper than anything you can run at home. (Phase 3 covers this in detail.)
- Have a modest laptop. Local models need real memory and ideally a decent graphics chip; on weak hardware they crawl. (Phase 2 covers the requirements.)
- Want it to work with zero setup. Cloud AI is a website and a login. Local AI is a download and a terminal - not hard, but not nothing.

Here is the honest summary: for most people, most of the time, cloud AI is the right default. It is sharper, faster, and needs no setup. Local AI earns its place in specific situations - privacy, cost at scale, offline, and tinkering. If one of those describes you, the rest of this guide gets you running. If none does, it is still worth knowing the option exists, because the situation that calls for it tends to arrive without warning.

A useful way to hold it: cloud AI is renting a sports car, local AI is owning a reliable sedan. The rental is faster and you never maintain it, but it is not in your garage, the company knows every trip you take, and you pay each time you drive. The sedan is yours, it is paid for, and it starts even when the rental office is closed.
