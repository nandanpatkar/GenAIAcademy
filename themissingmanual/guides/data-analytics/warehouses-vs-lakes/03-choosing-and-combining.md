# Choosing & Combining — It's Rarely Either/Or

If you've read the first two phases, you might be bracing for a verdict: warehouse or lake, pick a side.
The honest answer is that the question is mostly a false choice. The two solve different problems, and
the most common real-world setup uses **both**, deliberately, each doing the part it's good at.

This phase gives you the fair comparison first, then the pattern that ties them together, then the one
failure that quietly sinks lake projects.

## The honest comparison

This table covers *both* sides fairly — neither is the hero.

| | **Data Warehouse** | **Data Lake** |
|---|---|---|
| **Stores** | Structured, modeled tables | Anything: raw files, JSON, logs, images, Parquet |
| **Structure decided** | On write (schema-on-write), up front | On read (schema-on-read), at query time |
| **Storage** | Managed inside the warehouse | Cheap object storage (S3 / GCS / Azure Blob) |
| **Best at** | Fast aggregations, BI, trustworthy curated data | Flexibility, cheap raw history, ML, unstructured data |
| **Query speed** | Fast on big structured aggregations (columnar) | Depends on file layout and engine; can be slower on raw files |
| **Cost shape** | Higher per stored/queried unit; often pay-per-query/compute | Cheap storage; cost shifts to compute and to *making sense* of the mess |
| **Main risk** | Rigidity; change has a tax; awkward with raw/unstructured data | Becomes a "data swamp" without governance |
| **Who reaches for it** | Analysts, BI teams, finance/exec reporting | Data engineers, data scientists, ML teams |

💡 **Key point.** Read the "Best at" and "Main risk" rows together and the relationship is obvious: the
warehouse's strength (trustworthy, fast structured tables) is the lake's weakness, and the lake's strength
(cheap, flexible raw everything) is the warehouse's weakness. That complementarity is *why* combining
them is so common — not indecision, design.

## The common pattern: land in the lake, model in the warehouse

You don't have to choose — most mature data teams don't. The dominant pattern reads top to bottom:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  src[sources<br/>app DB · APIs · logs · events] -->|land raw| lake[(Lake — raw<br/>cheap object storage)]
  lake -->|model clean| wh[(Warehouse — curated<br/>structured, fast)]
  wh --> bi[BI dashboards / exec reporting]
  lake -->|raw, full-resolution| ml[Data science / ML]
```

**How it works in practice.**

1. **Land raw in the lake first.** Everything arrives in cheap object storage in roughly its original
   form — cheap insurance against questions you can't predict yet.
2. **Model curated tables in the warehouse.** From that raw material you build clean, structured, trusted
   tables — the ones BI dashboards and finance reports run on, fast and shaped for the questions the
   business actually asks.
3. **Let ML drink from the lake.** Data scientists often skip the curated warehouse tables and work
   directly from the raw lake, because models want full-resolution raw data, not pre-aggregated summaries.

*What this gets you:* the lake's cheap, flexible, keep-everything storage **and** the warehouse's fast,
trustworthy curated tables — each used for what it's genuinely good at, instead of forcing one tool to do
both jobs badly.

📝 **Where the lakehouse fits.** The lakehouse from [Phase 2](02-the-lake-and-lakehouse.md) collapses this
two-system pattern into one: warehouse-like curated tables living directly on lake storage, so you don't
run two separate systems. It can be a great fit, and it can also be more moving parts than a small team
needs — an option, not an obligation.

## A rough rule of thumb (judgment, not law)

This part is opinion, flagged as such — your context can override it.

- **Mostly structured data and BI/reporting needs, a smaller team?** A **warehouse alone** is often
  plenty, the simplest thing that works. Don't build a lake you don't need.
- **Lots of raw, varied, or unstructured data; ML ambitions; or large cheap history to keep?** You'll want
  a **lake**, very likely **feeding a warehouse** for the BI layer.
- **Already running both and tired of two systems?** That's when a **lakehouse** earns a serious look.

Start with the simplest setup that answers your actual questions, and add the other piece when a real
need shows up — not because an architecture diagram online had both boxes.

## The failure that sinks lakes: no governance

We've named the data swamp twice. Here's why it gets the last word: it's the single most common way
these projects fail, and it's entirely preventable.

⚠️ **Gotcha — a lake without governance becomes a data swamp, and a swamp is worse than no lake at all.**
When data lands freely with no catalog, no owners, and no documentation, the lake fills with files nobody
can identify or trust. People can't find the right dataset, can't tell which copy is current, and
eventually stop trusting *any* of it. You've now paid to store data and *also* lost the ability to use
it — strictly worse than never having built the lake.

**Why governance is the deciding factor.** Recall the asymmetry from
[Phase 2](02-the-lake-and-lakehouse.md): the warehouse's schema-on-write *forces* someone to think about
meaning and structure at load time. The lake removes that forcing function in exchange for flexibility.
If you don't consciously replace it with discipline, nothing else does. Governance isn't bureaucracy you
bolt on later; it's the thing that makes a lake a lake instead of a swamp.

**What "governance" concretely means** (not abstract — these are the moves):

- **A data catalog** — a searchable record of every dataset: what it is, its schema, where it lives, who
  owns it (for example, AWS Glue Data Catalog). If you can't search "what data do we have about orders?",
  you don't have governance yet.
- **Clear ownership** — every important dataset has a named team on the hook for its quality and meaning.
- **Defined zones** — at minimum a *raw* zone (untouched, as-landed) and a *curated* zone (cleaned,
  documented, trusted), so nobody mistakes raw mess for production-ready data.
- **Documentation and lifecycle** — what's current, what's deprecated, what can be deleted. Entropy is
  the default; documentation is how you push back.

🪖 **War story.** The saddest data project isn't the one that never got built — it's the lake that got
built *without* a catalog. Years of events faithfully captured, terabytes of genuinely valuable history,
and an analyst who needs "the orders data" facing forty folders named things like `orders_final_v2_REAL`.
The data was all there. Nobody could trust it, so in practice it may as well not have been. The cost of
governance is small and ongoing; the cost of skipping it is a swamp you can't drain.

## Recap

1. Warehouse vs lake is **rarely either/or** — they're complementary, and combining them is a design
   choice, not indecision.
2. The **warehouse** wins on fast, trustworthy, structured BI; the **lake** wins on cheap, flexible, raw,
   ML-friendly storage. Each is the other's weak spot.
3. The dominant pattern: **land raw in the lake, model curated tables in the warehouse for BI**, and let
   **ML work from the raw lake**. The **lakehouse** collapses this into one system — an option, not a
   requirement.
4. Pick the **simplest setup that answers your real questions**, and add the other piece when a genuine
   need appears.
5. **Governance is the deciding factor.** Without a catalog, owners, and zones, a lake rots into a **data
   swamp** that's worse than no lake at all.

You can now hold your own in the "warehouse or lake?" conversation — and point out the real answer is
usually "both, on purpose, with governance."
