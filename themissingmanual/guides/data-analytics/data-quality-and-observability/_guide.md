# Data Quality & Pipeline Observability

Your pipeline ran. The orchestrator shows a row of green checkmarks. The job exited zero, the dashboard
refreshed, and you moved on. A week later someone in a meeting says revenue is down 12% — and acts on it.
Budgets shift, a hire gets paused. Then someone notices the number is wrong: an upstream column quietly
started arriving as `null`, the pipeline averaged over the nulls, and nobody told anyone, because nothing
*crashed*. The job was green the whole time.

That is the nightmare this guide is about. Not the loud failure that pages you at 2am — you'll catch that.
The quiet one: a pipeline that *succeeds* while producing wrong data, and stays wrong until a decision is
built on top of it. Here's the relief: this is a solvable problem. Data can be tested like code, and a
running pipeline can be watched like a production service. This guide gives you the mental model for why
green isn't enough, the specific checks that catch silent breakage, and the observability that surfaces it
before a human ever sees the bad number.

## How to read this
- **Already convinced and want the checks?** Jump to [Phase 2: Data Quality Checks](02-data-quality-checks.md) for the dimensions worth testing and where to run them.
- **Want it to actually click — why trust is the whole product?** Read in order. Phase 1 installs the mental model the rest depends on.

## The phases
1. **[Why Trust Is the Whole Product](01-why-trust-is-the-whole-product.md)** — the mental model: data can be broken even when the job is green, and a silent data bug is worse than a loud crash, because no one knows to look.
2. **[Data Quality Checks](02-data-quality-checks.md)** — the dimensions worth testing automatically (freshness, volume, schema, validity), where to run them, and an annotated check that fails the pipeline before bad data spreads.
3. **[Pipeline Observability](03-pipeline-observability.md)** — seeing the whole system: lineage, monitoring and alerting on those checks, data SLAs, and avoiding the alert fatigue that turns every signal into noise.

> This guide is about *trusting* the data a pipeline produces. How those pipelines are built — the
> extract/transform/load mechanics, batch vs. streaming, the orchestration — lives in
> [ETL & ELT Pipelines](/guides/etl-elt-pipelines). If the words "pipeline" or "transform" feel fuzzy,
> read that first, then come back here to make what they produce trustworthy.
