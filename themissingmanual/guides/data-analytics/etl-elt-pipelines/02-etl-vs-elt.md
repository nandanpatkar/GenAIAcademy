# ETL vs ELT

You read the three stages in Phase 1 in the classic order: Extract, Transform, Load. Then someone on your team says "we do ELT now" and reorders two letters, and it feels like it should be a small thing. It isn't. Swapping the **T** and the **L** changes where your data gets cleaned, what hardware does the work, and whether you can ever recover the original raw data after a mistake.

The good news: there's only *one* difference between them, and once you see it the rest follows. Put the two side by side, then look at *why* the industry mostly moved from one to the other — a story about hardware getting cheaper, and one that tells you which fits *your* situation.

## The one difference, in a picture

Both pipelines do the same three jobs. The only question is whether **Transform** happens *before* or *after* the **Load**:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph ETL [ETL — transform first]
    direction LR
    E1[Extract] --> T1[Transform<br/>separate box] --> L1[Load<br/>clean data only]
  end
  subgraph ELT [ELT — load first]
    direction LR
    E2[Extract] --> L2[Load<br/>raw lands] --> T2[Transform<br/>SQL, in warehouse]
  end
```

That's the whole distinction. **ETL transforms on the way in; ELT transforms after it's already in.** Everything else — the trade-offs, the tooling, the team debates — flows from that.

## Why ETL came first: compute used to be expensive

**The world that created ETL.** For decades, the destination was a traditional data warehouse — powerful, but expensive and capacity-limited. You did *not* want to waste its precious compute cleaning messy data; you wanted it reserved for serving queries. So teams stood up a *separate* machine (an ETL server) to do all the transforming, and loaded only the finished, cleaned result into the warehouse.

**The logic was sound for its time:** transform on cheap commodity hardware, load only what's needed, keep the costly warehouse lean. ETL is a design shaped by scarcity — when warehouse compute is the bottleneck, you protect it.

**The cost of that design.** Because only the *transformed* data lands in the warehouse, the **raw data is gone** (or sitting in files nobody queries). If you later discover your transform had a bug, or you need a field you'd dropped, you can't just re-derive it — you have to re-extract from the source, if the source even still has it.

## Why ELT took over: the cloud warehouse changed the math

**What changed.** Modern cloud warehouses (the BigQuery / Snowflake / Redshift generation) made warehouse compute cheap and elastic — you can throw a lot of processing power at a problem and pay only for what you use. The bottleneck that justified ETL largely went away.

So the order flipped. With ELT you **load the raw data straight in, then transform it in place using the warehouse's own SQL engine.** The expensive separate transform box disappears; the warehouse does the heavy lifting it was once protected from.

This unlocks two things people genuinely value:

- **The raw data is preserved.** Because you load *before* transforming, the original lands in the warehouse and stays there. Found a bug in your revenue logic six months in? Fix the SQL and re-run the transform over the raw data you already have — no re-extraction, no begging the source system for history it may have purged.
- **You transform with SQL.** Transforms become SQL queries (often managed by tools like dbt) running where the data already sits. Anyone who can write SQL can read and change the logic — you don't need a separate processing framework or language for the transform stage.

> 📝 **Terminology.** People often describe ELT transforms as turning *raw* tables into *staged* and then *modeled* tables — successive SQL layers inside the warehouse, each more refined than the last. Same Phase 1 transform work; it just runs as SQL, in stages, in place.

## The honest comparison

Neither is "better" in the abstract — they fit different constraints. Here's both sides straight:

| | **ETL** (transform first) | **ELT** (load first) |
|---|---|---|
| Where transform runs | A separate processing server | Inside the warehouse, in SQL |
| What lands in the warehouse | Only cleaned data | Raw data first, then derived tables |
| Raw data after loading | Usually discarded / hard to reach | Preserved and queryable |
| Best when | Warehouse compute is scarce/expensive; or you must clean/mask data *before* it ever lands (e.g. compliance) | You have an elastic cloud warehouse and want flexibility + raw history |
| Transform skills needed | A processing framework (Spark, custom code) | SQL (often + dbt) |
| Typical era | Traditional on-prem warehouses | Modern cloud warehouses |

⚠️ **Gotcha — ELT means raw, possibly sensitive data lands first.** Loading before transforming is exactly what preserves raw history — but it also means personal or regulated data hits the warehouse *before* any masking. If you're under rules that forbid storing certain fields, transforming (or masking) *before* the load — the ETL pattern — may be a hard requirement, not a preference. Choose the order with that in mind.

💡 **Key point.** The choice isn't fashion. ELT wins where warehouse compute is cheap and you value keeping raw data; ETL still wins where compute is constrained or where data must be cleaned/masked before it can be stored at all. The order of two letters encodes a real engineering trade-off — name the constraint, and the right order is usually obvious.

> Whether you load into a *warehouse* (structured, SQL-first) or a *lake* (raw files, any format) shapes this decision too — ELT in particular leans on a capable destination. That comparison has its own home: [Warehouses vs. Lakes](/guides/warehouses-vs-lakes).

## Recap

1. **The only difference is order:** ETL transforms *before* loading; ELT loads raw *then* transforms in place.
2. **ETL was born of scarcity** — protect expensive warehouse compute by cleaning on a separate box and loading only the result.
3. **ELT rose with cheap cloud warehouses** — load raw, transform with SQL inside the warehouse.
4. **ELT's payoffs:** raw data preserved (re-run transforms without re-extracting) and transforms written in plain SQL.
5. **ETL still wins** when compute is constrained or data must be masked before it can land at all.

You can now read the data-stage of any pipeline and know *why* it's ordered the way it is. But knowing the stages and their order isn't enough to trust a pipeline. A pipeline runs on a schedule, with steps that depend on each other, and it *will* fail at 3am. Making it run *reliably* is the final piece.
