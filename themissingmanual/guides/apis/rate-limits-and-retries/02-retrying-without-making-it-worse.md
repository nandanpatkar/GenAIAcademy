# Retrying Without Making It Worse

You know the failure is probably temporary, so retrying feels obvious — and it is, right up until the
naive version bites you. Two failure stories haunt this phase. One: you retry in a tight `while` loop and
turn a momentary blip into a self-inflicted flood. Two: you retry a "create charge" call that *actually
succeeded* but timed out on the reply — and bill the customer twice. This phase gives you the recipe that
avoids both: wait longer each time, add randomness, cap your effort, and only retry what's safe to repeat.

## Don't retry instantly: exponential backoff

The first instinct — retry immediately, maybe in a loop — is the worst one. If the service is struggling,
a wall of instant retries is more load, which makes it struggle more. The fix is to **wait longer after
each failure**, and the standard pattern is **exponential backoff**: each wait roughly doubles.

```text
attempt 1  ->  fails  ->  wait ~1s
attempt 2  ->  fails  ->  wait ~2s
attempt 3  ->  fails  ->  wait ~4s
attempt 4  ->  fails  ->  wait ~8s
attempt 5  ->  give up (out of budget)
```

Instead of hammering, you backed off — 1, 2, 4, 8 seconds — giving the service room to recover. A short
hiccup gets caught by the early, quick retries; a longer outage doesn't get a flood from you, because your
waits stretch out fast. The doubling means you make only a handful of attempts even across many seconds.

📝 **Terminology.** *Backoff* = the wait you insert before a retry. *Exponential* = that wait grows
multiplicatively (×2 each time here), not by a fixed step. The base delay (1s here) and the multiplier
(2×) are yours to tune; doubling from ~1s is a sane default.

## The bit everyone forgets: jitter

Here's the trap that catches teams who "did backoff right." Imagine the service blips and a thousand of
your clients all fail at the same instant. With pure exponential backoff, all thousand wait *exactly* 1
second, then all thousand retry *at the same moment*. You've synchronized a thousand clients into a
drumbeat of simultaneous spikes — every retry round lands as one giant wave. That's a self-made
**thundering herd** (much more on this in Phase 3).

The fix is **jitter**: add randomness to each wait so the retries spread out instead of clumping.

```text
without jitter (everyone waits exactly 2s):
   all clients ->|             |<- one big spike at t=2s

with jitter (each waits a random slice up to 2s):
   clients spread ->| . . . . . |<- load smeared across the window
```

Jitter smeared the retry wave across the whole window instead of stacking it into one spike. The service
sees a gentle trickle it can actually absorb, rather than a synchronized wall.

A simple, widely used recipe is **"full jitter"**: instead of waiting the full computed backoff, wait a
*random* amount between zero and that backoff.

```python runnable
import random

base = 1.0          # base delay in seconds
cap = 30.0          # never wait longer than this
for attempt in range(5):
    backoff = min(cap, base * (2 ** attempt))   # 1, 2, 4, 8, 16
    wait = random.uniform(0, backoff)           # full jitter: random slice of it
    print(f"attempt {attempt + 1}: backoff window={backoff:.0f}s, actually wait={wait:.2f}s")
```

The backoff *window* still doubles (1, 2, 4, 8, 16s), but the actual wait is a random point inside that
window — so two clients running this same code almost never wait the same amount, and their retries don't
collide. The `cap` keeps a long outage from producing absurd 10-minute waits.

💡 **Key point.** Exponential backoff *without* jitter is a known foot-gun: it turns many clients into a
synchronized herd. Backoff decides *how long*; jitter decides *who goes when*. You need both.

## Know when to stop: a retry budget

Retrying forever is its own bug. If the service is genuinely down for an hour, infinite retries pile up
work, hold connections open, and can take *your* service down too. So you give yourself a **budget** and
give up gracefully when it's spent.

A budget is usually one or both of:

- **Max attempts** — e.g. "try at most 5 times, then fail."
- **A deadline** — e.g. "keep retrying, but stop after 30 seconds total, no matter the attempt count."

```text
budget: 5 attempts OR 30s total, whichever comes first

if attempts >= 5            -> stop, surface the error
if elapsed_seconds >= 30    -> stop, surface the error
otherwise                   -> back off (with jitter) and try again
```

You bounded the effort in *both* dimensions. The deadline matters because a few exponential backoffs can
quietly add up to a long time — you want a hard ceiling so a stuck operation doesn't hang a user's request
for minutes. When the budget runs out, you stop and report a clean failure rather than retrying into the
void.

⚠️ **Beware nested retries.** If your client retries, and the library *it* calls also retries, and the
service behind *that* retries too, the attempts multiply: 3 × 3 × 3 = 27 real requests for one logical
call. This "retry amplification" is a notorious way to accidentally DDoS yourself. Pick *one* layer to
own retries and turn the others off.

## The golden rule: only retry what's safe to repeat

This is the rule that separates a safe retry from a money-losing one. Before retrying, ask: **if this
request already ran, is running it again harmless?**

That property has a name you met if you read the webhooks guide: **idempotency**. An operation is
idempotent if doing it twice has the same effect as doing it once.

- `GET /users/42` — reading. Run it a hundred times; nothing changes. **Safe to retry.**
- `DELETE /sessions/abc` — deleting. Already gone? Deleting again is still "gone." **Safe to retry.**
- `PUT /users/42 {name: "Sam"}` — setting to a value. Same result every time. **Safe to retry.**
- `POST /charges {amount: 5000}` — *creating* a charge. Retry a timed-out one and you might **bill twice.**
  **Not safe** — unless you make it safe.

The danger case is the timed-out write. Your `POST` to create a charge may have *succeeded* on the server
while the *response* got lost on the way back. From your side it looks like a failure. Retry it naively
and you've created a second charge.

```text
you: POST /charges  ----------------->  server: charge created
you: (no response — network dropped it)  <-- response lost here
you: "looks failed, retry!"  -------->  server: ANOTHER charge created  💸
```

The lost *response*, not a lost request, is what makes blind retries dangerous on writes. The work
happened; only your confirmation went missing. A naive retry does the work a second time.

## The fix for unsafe retries: idempotency keys

You can't make "create a charge" naturally idempotent — each call is meant to create something new. So
serious APIs give you a tool: an **idempotency key**. You generate a unique ID for the *logical*
operation and send it with the request. The server remembers that key. If it sees the same key twice, it
returns the *original* result instead of doing the work again.

```http
POST /v1/charges HTTP/1.1
Idempotency-Key: a1b2c3-charge-order-9921
Content-Type: application/json

{ "amount": 5000, "currency": "usd", "source": "tok_visa" }
```

You stamped this charge with a key tied to the *order*, not the attempt. The first time the server sees
`a1b2c3-charge-order-9921`, it creates the charge and records the result against the key. When your retry
arrives with the *same* key, the server recognizes it, skips creating a second charge, and returns the
first charge's response. One key, one charge — no matter how many times the network makes you retry.

📝 **Terminology.** *Idempotency key* = a caller-generated unique ID for one logical operation, sent so
the server can deduplicate retries. Generate it *once per operation* and reuse it across that operation's
retries — if you make a fresh key every attempt, you've defeated the whole point.

💡 **Key point.** Retry idempotent requests freely. For non-idempotent ones (most `POST`s that create or
charge), either don't retry, or use an idempotency key so the server can make the retry safe. "Could this
double-charge?" is the question to ask before every retry of a write.

## Putting it together

A safe retry loop, in plain terms:

```text
for each attempt, until the budget is spent:
    send the request
    if it succeeded                      -> return the result
    if it failed with a 4xx (not 429)    -> stop; retrying won't help
    if it failed with 429 or 5xx:
        if the response had Retry-After  -> wait that long
        else                             -> wait backoff(attempt) with jitter
        (writes carry the same idempotency key on every attempt)
budget spent -> surface a clean error
```

Every habit from this phase is in there — honor `Retry-After` when given, otherwise exponential backoff
*with jitter*, stop on permanent errors, respect a budget, and keep the idempotency key constant across
attempts. That loop turns a flaky dependency into a non-event.

## For builders

Reach for a battle-tested retry library before hand-rolling this — most ecosystems have one that gives you
backoff, jitter, and budgets in a few lines, and they've already fixed the bugs you'd hit. Your real job
is *configuration with judgment*: set sane caps, add jitter (confirm the default actually does), retry
only transient statuses, and decide per-endpoint whether a retry could double a side effect. Phase 3
covers what to do when even a perfect retry policy isn't enough — when a dependency is *down*.
