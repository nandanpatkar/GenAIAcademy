# gRPC, Explained

You've shipped REST APIs. You know how to design a JSON endpoint, read a `404`, and `curl` something to
see what comes back. Then someone on your team says "we're putting this service behind gRPC" and suddenly
there's a `.proto` file, a code-generation step in the build, and a binary payload you can't read in your
browser. It feels like a different universe with its own rules nobody wrote down for you.

It isn't magic, and it isn't a replacement for everything you know. gRPC is a focused tool that solves one
problem really well: letting *internal services call each other* quickly, with a strict typed contract both
sides agree on in advance. This guide installs that mental model first, shows how the pieces actually
work, and ends with an honest look at when gRPC is the right call and when it absolutely isn't.

## How to read this
- **Just need the "REST vs GraphQL vs gRPC, when do I use which" answer?** Jump to the table at the top of
  [Phase 3: The Honest Trade-offs](03-the-honest-trade-offs.md).
- **Want it to finally make sense?** Read in order — each phase builds on the last. The mental model in
  Phase 1 is what makes the machinery in Phase 2 feel obvious.

## The phases
1. **[The Problem gRPC Solves](01-the-problem-grpc-solves.md)** — why services that call each other
   thousands of times need speed *and* a strict typed contract, and how gRPC delivers both.
2. **[How gRPC Works](02-how-grpc-works.md)** — the `.proto` file, code generation, binary serialization,
   and the four call types (unary plus three streaming modes), at a gentle level.
3. **[The Honest Trade-offs](03-the-honest-trade-offs.md)** — what you give up (human-readable payloads,
   easy browser support), what you gain, and a fair REST-vs-GraphQL-vs-gRPC "when to use which" table.

> Deep material — custom interceptors, deadlines and retries, load balancing, mutual TLS, and the wire
> format byte-by-byte — is deliberately left out so this stays a guide and not a reference manual. Once the
> model here clicks, the official docs at grpc.io read much more easily.
