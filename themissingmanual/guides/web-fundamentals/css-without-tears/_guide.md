# CSS Without Tears

You just finished `html-from-zero` and you have a plain "About Me" page: black text, blue links,
default font, top to bottom, no personality. That page is correct HTML and it looks like it's from
1998. CSS is what turns it into something you'd actually want someone to see.

The reason CSS feels chaotic at first is that it looks like a flat list of rules with no logic
connecting them - until you learn the small set of ideas everything else builds on. Which selector
wins when two rules disagree. What "the box model" means for every single element on the page. Why
`rem` behaves differently from `px`. What `position` actually repositions relative to. Once those four
ideas click, the rest of CSS is vocabulary you can look up as needed.

This guide styles that one "About Me" page from nothing to a finished layout, one phase at a time.

## How to read this
- **Want it to finally make sense?** Read in order - each phase styles more of the same page and
  depends on the last.
- **Already comfortable with basics, need positioning?** Jump straight to
  [Phase 4: Positioning](04-positioning.md).

## The phases

1. **[Selectors and the Cascade](01-selectors-and-the-cascade.md)** - how CSS picks which rule wins,
   what inherits from parent to child, and when `!important` is a legitimate escape hatch.
2. **[The Box Model](02-the-box-model.md)** - what padding, border, and margin actually do to an
   element's size, and why `box-sizing: border-box` is in almost every real stylesheet.
3. **[Colors, Units, and Typography](03-colors-units-and-typography.md)** - hex vs. rgb vs. hsl, why
   `rem` beats `px` for font sizes, and the line-height mistake almost everyone makes.
4. **[Positioning](04-positioning.md)** - `static`, `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, and `sticky`,
   worked through a sticky header and a centered modal.

Real layout systems - lining elements up in rows, columns, and grids - are their own guide:
[Flexbox and Grid](/guides/flexbox-and-grid). This guide is what you need before that one makes sense.
