# Kubernetes, Explained Without the Hype

You know containers now. You can build an image, run it, wire a few together. Then someone says the word
*Kubernetes*, and the ground tilts: clusters, pods, control planes, YAML by the kilometer, a `kubectl` command
for everything and a different one for the same thing. It gets talked about like a rite of passage and a magic
scaling button at the same time, and neither of those is true.

Here's the honest version. Kubernetes is a **container orchestrator** - software whose entire job is to run a
lot of containers across a lot of machines and keep them running the way you said you wanted, without you
babysitting them. That's the whole idea. It is genuinely powerful, and it is genuinely heavy, and most small
apps do not need it. This guide installs the mental model, shows you the few objects you actually touch, and
then gives you a straight answer to the question nobody seems to ask out loud: *should you even use this?*

## How to read this

- **Just need the verdict?** Jump to [Phase 3: Should You Even Use It?](03-should-you-even-use-it.md) - it
  lays out, plainly, when Kubernetes earns its keep and when a VPS or a PaaS will make you far happier.
- **Want it to finally make sense?** Read in order. Phase 1 is the one idea everything rests on, Phase 2 is the
  pieces you'll actually meet, and Phase 3 is the honest cost-benefit.

## The phases

1. **[The Problem K8s Solves](01-the-problem-k8s-solves.md)** - running many containers across many machines by
   hand is brutal: placement, restarts, scaling, networking, rollouts. Kubernetes is the thing that does that
   for you. The core mental model: you *declare* a desired state ("I want 3 of these running"), and it works
   continuously to make reality match.
2. **[The Core Objects](02-the-core-objects.md)** - the pieces you really meet: the **Pod** (your container's
   wrapper), the **Deployment** (desired replicas + safe rollouts), the **Service** (a stable address + load
   balancing), and the **control loop** that quietly reconciles actual back to desired. With annotated YAML and
   real `kubectl` transcripts.
3. **[Should You Even Use It?](03-should-you-even-use-it.md)** - the part the hype skips. Kubernetes is powerful
   *and* complex; the operational cost is real. When a [VPS](/guides/deploying-to-a-vps) or a PaaS is the right
   answer, when k8s actually earns it, and how to avoid resume-driven Kubernetes.
