# What SSH Is

You've used a terminal on your own computer: type a command, your machine runs it, you see the output. SSH
is that exact experience - except the machine running your commands is somewhere else. A server in a data
center. A Raspberry Pi in your closet. A cloud box you rented ten minutes ago. You type on your keyboard, the
commands travel across the internet, the *other* machine runs them, and its output travels back to your
screen.

That's the whole idea. Let's make it solid before touching a single command.

## What SSH actually is

**What it actually is.** SSH stands for **Secure Shell**. A *shell* is the program that reads your typed
commands and runs them (the thing you're already using locally). SSH gives you a shell on a *remote*
machine, with every keystroke and every byte of output **encrypted** as it crosses the network. Picture a
sealed pipe between your terminal and the far machine: anyone watching the wire in between sees only
scrambled noise.

📝 **Terminology.** People say "SSH into the server," "SSH to the box," or just "ssh in." All three mean the
same thing: open an encrypted shell session on a remote machine.

**Why people get this wrong.** Newcomers imagine SSH *transfers files* or *is a website thing*. It isn't. SSH
gives you a **command line on another computer** - the same prompt you'd get sitting at its keyboard.
(Copying files happens *over* SSH with separate tools like `scp`; a follow-up topic.) If you can use a
terminal, you already know how to use a machine over SSH. The only new part is getting *in*.

**Why this matters.** Before SSH, people logged into remote machines with Telnet, which sent everything -
including your password - as plain readable text across the network, for anyone in between to read. SSH
exists to fix exactly that: prove who you are and carry your session, all encrypted.

## The command: `ssh user@host`

**What it actually is.** One command opens a session. Here's the anatomy:

```text
   ssh   ada @ server.example.com
   │     │   │
   │     │   └── the host: which machine to connect to
   │     │       (a domain name, or a raw IP like 203.0.113.10)
   │     └────── the @ separates "who" from "where"
   └──────────── the user: which account to log in AS on that machine
```

So `ssh ada@server.example.com` means: *"Connect to the machine at `server.example.com` and log me in as the
user `ada`."* The user is an account **on the remote machine**, not your local username - though leaving off
`user@` makes SSH assume the remote username matches your local one.

**A real example.** Here's a first connection. Read the whole thing; we'll unpack the surprising middle part
next.

```console
$ ssh ada@server.example.com
The authenticity of host 'server.example.com (203.0.113.10)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:Vlt8x2pQ0r9kZ3mC7nB1aF6dH4jL5sT0uW8yE2gXoI.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added 'server.example.com' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
ada@server.example.com's password:
Welcome to Ubuntu 24.04 LTS

ada@server:~$
```

*What just happened:* a lot, in a calm order. SSH reached the remote machine, asked a one-time trust question
(the fingerprint block, explained next), accepted your `yes`, asked for `ada`'s password, and dropped you at
a **new prompt**: `ada@server:~$`. That last line is the tell - your prompt changed. You are no longer typing
into your own computer; every command from here runs *on the server*, as `ada`.

⚠️ **Gotcha - passwords here are invisible.** When SSH asks for a password, your terminal shows **nothing**
as you type - no dots, no stars, no moving cursor. This is on purpose (so nobody reads your password length
over your shoulder), but it makes everyone think the keyboard is broken the first time. It isn't - type the
password and press Enter. (Phase 2 replaces passwords with keys, which skip this prompt entirely.)

## That first-connection fingerprint prompt

This is the part that makes people nervous, so let's defuse it.

**What it actually is.** The very first time you connect to a machine, SSH has never seen it before, so it
can't be sure the thing answering is the *real* server and not an impostor in the middle. It shows you the
server's **host-key fingerprint** - a short, unique label derived from its identity - and asks you to confirm
it.

```text
   This is SSH saying:
   "Someone is claiming to be server.example.com. Their ID badge reads
    SHA256:Vlt8x2pQ...XoI. Do you trust this is who you meant to reach?"
```

**What it does in real life.** When you answer `yes`, SSH writes that fingerprint to a file on *your* machine
called `~/.ssh/known_hosts`. From then on, every time you connect, SSH silently checks that the server's
fingerprint still matches what it recorded. If it matches, you're not asked again - that's why you only see
this prompt once per machine. (The "Permanently added... to the list of known hosts" line is SSH telling you
it just saved the record.)

**The gotcha - and why this is a feature, not a nuisance.** If you connect later and the fingerprint has
*changed*, SSH will loudly refuse and warn you, because a changed key can mean someone is impersonating the
server. Most of the time it's innocent (the server was rebuilt and got a new identity), but SSH errs on the
side of stopping you. We cover that warning, and the safe way to clear it, in the
[Phase 3 cheat-card](03-living-with-ssh.md).

💡 **Key point.** The fingerprint prompt isn't a hurdle - it's SSH protecting you. If you genuinely set up or
were given this server, `yes` is correct: the first `yes` is you teaching your machine what the real server
looks like.

## What a "session" is

**What it actually is.** A **session** is the live connection from the moment you log in to the moment you
leave. While the session is open, your terminal is a window into the remote machine. Whatever you'd do
sitting at its keyboard, you do here.

**What it does in real life.** Try a couple of harmless commands once you're in, and watch where they run:

```console
ada@server:~$ whoami
ada
ada@server:~$ hostname
server
ada@server:~$ pwd
/home/ada
```

*What just happened:* `whoami` reported `ada` (the remote account you logged in as, not your local
username), `hostname` reported the *server's* name, and `pwd` ("print working directory") showed you're
sitting in `ada`'s home folder **on the server** - confirming what the changed prompt already hinted: you're
operating on the remote machine.

**Ending the session.** When you're done, you leave:

```console
ada@server:~$ exit
logout
Connection to server.example.com closed.
$
```

*What just happened:* `exit` (or `Ctrl-D`) closed the remote shell. The session ended, the encrypted pipe was
torn down, and your prompt snapped back to `$` - you're home, on your own machine again. Nothing you ran
remotely keeps running locally; the two were only joined for the life of the session.

⚠️ **Gotcha - know which machine you're on.** The single most common beginner mistake is forgetting whether
a prompt is local or remote, then running a command (especially a destructive one) on the wrong machine.
Your anchor is the **prompt**: `ada@server:~$` means you're *on the server*; a bare `$` means you're home.
When in doubt, run `hostname` - it never lies about where you are.

## Recap

1. **SSH = Secure Shell.** It's a command line on another computer, with everything encrypted on the wire.
2. **`ssh user@host`** opens a session: log in as `user` on the machine `host`.
3. **The fingerprint prompt** appears once per machine - it's SSH asking you to confirm the server is real,
   then saving that fact in `~/.ssh/known_hosts`.
4. **Passwords typed at the SSH prompt are invisible** by design - keep typing.
5. **A session** lasts from login to `exit`; your prompt changing is the sign you've arrived.

You can already get in with a password. The trouble with passwords is that they're typed, guessable, and
travel each time you connect. Next, we replace them with something far better.
