# Debugging in the Browser

The page is broken. A button does nothing, the data won't load, a section is the wrong color - and you're
staring at the screen with no idea where to even look. Most people respond by scattering `console.log`
everywhere and refreshing, hoping a clue falls out. There's a calmer way: the browser already ships a full
debugging toolkit (the DevTools), and three of its panels answer almost every "why is this broken?" you'll
ever have.

This guide isn't a button tour of one browser. It teaches the four panels you actually use - Console,
Sources, Network, Elements - as a way of *thinking*, so the moves carry over whether you're in Chrome,
Edge, Firefox, or Safari.

## How to read this

- **New to DevTools?** Read in order. Phase 1 gives you the map and the Console; Phase 2 teaches real
  breakpoints and the Network tab; Phase 3 walks a full investigation start to finish.
- **Already comfortable in the Console?** Skip to [Phase 2](02-breakpoints-and-the-network-tab.md) - that's
  where breakpoints beat scattered logging.

## The phases

1. **[The DevTools Map and the Console](01-the-devtools-map-and-the-console.md)** - the mental model: DevTools
   is a window into the *running* page. Open it, read errors, log and live-evaluate in the Console.
2. **[Breakpoints and the Network Tab](02-breakpoints-and-the-network-tab.md)** - pause your JavaScript with
   breakpoints (step over / into, watch expressions, the call stack) instead of scattering logs, and use the
   Network tab to find the request that failed.
3. **[A Real Investigation](03-a-real-investigation.md)** - walk one "why is this broken?" bug end to end
   across Console, Network, Sources, and Elements, plus the gotchas that send people chasing ghosts.

and they're far less scary once you can read them.
