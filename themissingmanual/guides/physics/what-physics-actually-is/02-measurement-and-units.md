# Measurement and Units (Your Built-In Mistake Detector)

## A number alone is a lie

Someone tells you the trip is "5." Five what? Five minutes is a coffee run. Five hours is an afternoon gone. Five days is a holiday. The number `5` by itself carries almost no information - and worse, it *feels* like it does, which is how it fools you.

This is the first hard rule of measurement, and it sounds too obvious to matter until it saves you: **a physical quantity is a number *and* a unit, always together, never apart.** "5 metres." "20 seconds." "9.8 metres per second per second." The unit isn't decoration tacked onto the number. It's half the meaning. Drop it and you've thrown away the half that tells you what kind of thing you're even talking about.

A famous spacecraft was lost because one team worked in one set of units and another team assumed a different set, and nobody reconciled the two. The numbers matched. The units didn't. The number alone was a lie, and it cost a mission.

## Why we agree on a small set of units

You could measure distance in your own footsteps and time in heartbeats, and for personal use that's fine. But the moment you want to *share* a prediction - hand your model to someone across the world and have them get the same answer - everyone needs the same rulers.

So science settled on a shared set, the SI units. You don't need to memorize the whole table. A handful carries most of what you'll meet early:

```text
Quantity     SI unit        Symbol    "It's roughly..."
--------     -------        ------    ----------------
length       metre          m         a long stride
mass         kilogram       kg        a full water bottle
time         second         s         one heartbeat-ish
```

*What just happened:* we picked fixed, agreed reference sizes so that "3 metres" means the same thing in Lagos, Lima, and London. Everything else - speed, force, energy - gets *built* from these few. Speed is metres per second. That "per" is doing real work: it's a division, baked right into the unit.

## Units are math you can do on the labels

Here's the quietly powerful part. Units obey arithmetic. You can multiply, divide, and cancel them exactly like numbers - and when you do, they tell you whether your calculation even makes sense *before* you trust the answer.

Say you drive 120 kilometres in 2 hours and want your speed.

```text
speed = distance / time
      = 120 km / 2 h
      = 60 km/h        <- the units divided right alongside the numbers
```

*What just happened:* the `km` and `h` didn't vanish - they combined into `km/h`, which is exactly what a speed *should* be measured in. The units came out describing the right kind of thing, which is your first signal the calculation is sound.

Now watch them catch a mistake. Suppose you fumble and *multiply* distance by time instead of dividing:

```text
120 km x 2 h = 240 km·h
```

*What just happened:* `km·h` - kilometre-hours - is not a unit of anything you'd ever want. Speed is never measured in kilometre-hours. The units came out nonsensical, and that nonsense is a flashing warning light: you used the wrong operation. You caught the error without knowing the right answer, only by reading the labels.

## The trick that checks your work for free

This is called dimensional analysis, and it's the cheapest insurance in physics. Before you trust any result, ask: *do the units of my answer match the units the answer should have?*

Remember the falling stone from phase 1. The rule was distance equals one-half times 9.8 times time-squared. Let's check it on the labels alone, ignoring the actual numbers:

```text
The "9.8" is an acceleration: metres per second, per second  ->  m/s^2
Time squared is:  s x s  ->  s^2

m/s^2  x  s^2  =  m x (s^2 / s^2)  =  m x 1  =  m
                                  ^^^^^^^^^
                       the seconds cancel completely
```

*What just happened:* we multiplied the units and the seconds-squared cancelled the per-seconds-squared, leaving plain metres. A distance *should* come out in metres - and it did. We've now confirmed the formula is built correctly without computing a single digit. If those units had come out as `m/s` or `s`, we'd know the formula was wrong before wasting time plugging in numbers.

> Make this a reflex: glance at the units of your answer before you believe it. Right units don't prove you're correct, but wrong units *prove* you're wrong - and that catch is free.

**For builders:** units are types. `5` is an untyped number waiting to be misused; `5 metres` is a typed value that refuses to be added to `5 seconds`. Dimensional analysis is the compiler check that runs in your head - same reason a typed function signature catches a category of bugs before the code ever runs. Mixing metres and feet is the physics version of passing a string where an integer was expected.

## Precision is a measurement too

When you measure something, you don't get infinite digits - you get as many as your instrument can resolve. A tape measure gives you millimetres, not nanometres. So when you write "the bridge is 20 metres," you're really saying "somewhere close to 20, give or take." Reporting a falling time as "2.0000001 seconds" from a rough height estimate is claiming a precision you never had. Good physics keeps your answer's confidence honest with your measurement's confidence. Carrying ten decimal places from a one-decimal-place ruler is its own kind of lie.

    "q": "Why is a physical quantity always a number paired with a unit?",
    "choices": [
      "Units make equations look more professional",
      "The unit carries half the meaning; the number alone doesn't say what kind of thing it is",
      "It's a convention with no practical effect",
      "Only large numbers need units"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "A bare '5' could be minutes, metres, or kilograms. The unit tells you what the number measures, which is half the information."
  },

      "The answer must be exactly correct",
      "The units came out as a valid speed, a first signal the calculation is sound",
      "You should convert everything to metres first"
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explain": "Units follow the same arithmetic as numbers. Getting sensible units (km/h for a speed) is evidence your operation was right; nonsense units flag an error."

      "Your answer is definitely correct",
      "It proves the calculation is wrong, even before you compute the number",
      "You only need more decimal places"
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explain": "Right units don't prove correctness, but wrong units prove the calculation is broken - a free error check before you trust any digits."
