# Information Theory Meets Physics

In 1948, Claude Shannon needed a word for how much uncertainty a message resolves, and he asked John von Neumann what to call it. Von Neumann's answer, as the story goes: call it entropy - the formula is identical to Boltzmann's, and "nobody knows what entropy really is, so you'll win every argument."

It's a good story, and better than a joke. The two entropies are not merely similar in spirit, decorated with the same word by coincidence or convenience. They are the same mathematical object, applied to two different questions, and that identity is not a curiosity sitting off to the side of this guide - it's the reason everything in Phases 1 and 2 is true.

## Two entropies, one formula

Boltzmann's thermodynamic entropy, from [/guides/heat-energy-and-entropy](/guides/heat-energy-and-entropy), counts microstates: `S = k log W`, where `W` is the number of microscopic arrangements consistent with a system's observable state, and `k` is Boltzmann's constant, which fixes the units to joules per kelvin.

Shannon's information entropy measures the uncertainty in a message or a random variable: `H = -Σ p(x) log p(x)`, summed over every possible outcome `x`, where `p(x)` is that outcome's probability. A fair coin flip has two equally likely outcomes and `H = log 2`. A coin that always lands heads has `H = 0` - no uncertainty, no information gained by watching it.

Set aside the constant `k` (it only exists to convert an entropy count into joules-per-kelvin units, a bookkeeping choice with no content) and Boltzmann's formula is the special case of Shannon's where every one of the `W` microstates is equally likely: `p(x) = 1/W` for each, and Shannon's sum collapses exactly to `log W`. Boltzmann entropy isn't "like" Shannon entropy. It's Shannon entropy, evaluated on the uniform distribution over microstates, with a unit conversion applied.

This isn't numerology. Both formulas answer the identical underlying question: *given what you know about a system's macroscopic state, how many distinguishable configurations remain, and how surprised should you be to learn which one it actually is?* Ask that question about a gas and you get thermodynamic entropy. Ask it about a coin flip, a compressed file, or a bit in a register, and you get Shannon entropy. Same question, same math, different subject matter.

## Why this makes Landauer's principle work

This identity is the reason Phase 1's claim - that erasing a bit has a real thermodynamic energy cost - isn't a metaphor borrowed from physics to make a point about computers. It's a direct consequence.

A bit with an unknown value has two equally likely microstates (0 or 1), so its Shannon entropy is `log 2`. Because Shannon entropy and thermodynamic entropy are the same quantity, that bit's *physical* microstate count also carries `log 2` worth of entropy, in the literal Boltzmann sense - the same sense that applies to a box of gas. Erasing the bit forces it to one definite state, dropping its entropy to `log 1 = 0`. That drop isn't a figurative "entropy" standing in for a physical idea - it is thermodynamic entropy, full stop, and the second law governs it exactly as it governs a gas that's been compressed into a smaller volume. The dropped entropy has to reappear somewhere else - as heat in the environment - because the underlying law doesn't know or care whether the microstates it's counting belong to gas molecules or to a transistor's charge state.

If Shannon entropy and Boltzmann entropy were only analogous rather than identical, Landauer's principle would have no right to be literally true. It would be a suggestive metaphor, the kind of thing said in a talk and forgotten by the next slide. It's not a metaphor, because there's only one entropy underneath both names, and that's precisely why the k·T·ln 2 bound from Phase 1 is a real, measurable number of joules and not a rhetorical flourish.

## The myth worth killing here

The popular version of this story often runs backward: "information is a kind of energy" or "bits are made of entropy," phrasings that sound profound and explain nothing. Information isn't energy, and a bit isn't made of entropy. What's true and precise is narrower and more useful: *the number of physical microstates available to a system is the same mathematical quantity whether you're counting them to describe a gas's temperature or to describe what a message could have said.* Entropy is the accounting method, shared by both domains because both domains are, underneath, about counting possibilities consistent with partial knowledge. Erasing a bit lowers that count exactly the way compressing a gas does, which is why it costs energy exactly the way compressing a gas does.

## Why this matters practically, not only philosophically

Zoom out to what this guide has actually established across three phases: a bit is a physical state (Phase 1), erasing it has a real energy floor because doing so is a genuine thermodynamic entropy decrease (Phase 1, sharpened here), heat dissipation from switching real transistors is a hard wall current chip design runs straight into (Phase 2), and reversible computing is a legitimate but unfinished attempt to route around the erasure cost specifically, rather than the switching losses (Phase 2).

None of that is a story about current silicon being immature. It's a story about what computation *is*. Every computer that will ever be built - optical, biological, superconducting, quantum, or something not yet invented - manipulates physical systems, and physical systems answer to thermodynamics whether or not their designers were thinking about it. A future computer might get breathtakingly close to the Landauer floor, might dissipate heat a million times more efficiently than today's chips, might use reversible logic throughout. It cannot erase a bit for less than k·T·ln 2, because that number isn't a property of transistors. It's a property of what erasure *means*, expressed in the one formula that thermodynamics and information theory turned out to share all along.
