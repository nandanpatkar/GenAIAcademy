# What it actually buys you, and the sober reality

You now have the real mental model: interference, not parallel-universe brute force. That's the only honest way to answer what this thing can actually do. There are a few places where quantum computing gives a genuine, dramatic advantage - and vastly more where it gives nothing. Even where the advantage is real, the hardware to claim it isn't here yet.

## The real wins

Two algorithms come up again and again, because they're the clearest cases where interference can be arranged to do something classical computers can't match.

### Shor's algorithm: factoring, and the threat to encryption

Some math problems are easy to do forward and brutally hard to undo. Multiplying two large prime numbers is quick; taking the giant result and recovering the two primes - **factoring** - is so slow on classical computers that for big enough numbers it would take longer than anyone can wait. Much of today's public-key cryptography, including **RSA**, rests its security on exactly that slowness. (If "primes" and "why factoring is hard" are fuzzy, [/guides/number-theory-the-secret-life-of-integers](/guides/number-theory-the-secret-life-of-integers) lays the groundwork.)

**Shor's algorithm** uses quantum interference to factor large numbers dramatically faster than any known classical method. It's quantum computing's most famous real advantage: a large enough quantum computer running Shor's algorithm would break RSA and several of its cousins.

That's why **post-quantum cryptography** exists: new encryption schemes built on math problems that Shor's algorithm (and quantum computers generally) don't appear to speed up. The world is already migrating to these quantum-resistant schemes ahead of the hardware that would break the old ones.

*What just happened:* the famous "quantum breaks encryption" headline is true, but specific. It's not that quantum computers break *all* security - it's that one algorithm undermines the *particular* kind of cryptography that depends on factoring being slow, and we already have replacements.

### Grover's algorithm: a square-root speedup for searching

Suppose you're hunting for one entry in a giant unsorted pile and you have no shortcut - classically you might have to check, on average, about half of everything. **Grover's algorithm** uses interference to find it faster, needing roughly the **square root** of the number of checks instead.

Square root is a real, useful speedup - for a list of a trillion, the square root is a million. But it's not the explosive, exponential-class leap that Shor's gives for factoring - a meaningful gear change, not a different universe. Grover's is often oversold as "instant search"; it isn't instant, it's quadratically faster.

```text
  classical unsorted search:  about  N   checks
  Grover's (quantum):         about  √N  checks

  N = 1,000,000,000,000  →  classical ~ a trillion
                            Grover's  ~ a million
  real and large - but a square-root gain, not magic
```

## The much larger set of problems it does NOT speed up

This is the half the hype always skips.

A quantum computer only helps when someone can design an interference pattern that concentrates amplitude on the right answer for that problem. For most everyday computing, no such pattern is known - and for many problems there's good reason to believe none exists. Concretely:

- **Most ordinary software gets zero benefit.** Spreadsheets, web pages, video rendering, the software you use daily - none of it is the kind of problem interference can grab.
- **A square-root speedup, where it applies at all, is often not worth it.** Quantum hardware is slow and finicky per operation; a mere quadratic gain can be eaten alive by that overhead.
- **Many famously hard problems are not known to fall.** The hardest optimization problems - the ones people most *wish* quantum would crush - mostly don't have a known dramatic quantum speedup. Quantum computing is a sharp specialized tool, not a universal accelerator.

The accurate one-liner: **a quantum computer is not a faster computer. It's a different kind of computer that wins big on a narrow set of problems and ties or loses on everything else.**

## The sober hardware reality

Even for the problems where the advantage is real, there's a gap between the algorithm on paper and the machine on the bench. Three facts define that gap.

**Decoherence.** A qubit's superposition is fragile - the faintest leak of information to the outside world (a stray vibration, a hint of heat, a magnetic nudge) scrambles the delicate amplitudes. That loss is called **decoherence**, the central enemy. Qubits are isolated obsessively, often chilled to near absolute zero, and even then hold their state for only a brief window before the quantum-ness drains away.

**Error rates.** Because of decoherence and imperfect control, today's quantum operations are *noisy* - each gate has a real chance of going slightly wrong. Errors accumulate as a computation gets longer, which puts a hard ceiling on how much useful work a raw machine can do before the answer turns to mush.

**Quantum error correction, and its steep price.** The fix is **quantum error correction**: spread the information of one reliable, idealized qubit - a **logical qubit** - across many noisy real ones - **physical qubits** - so errors can be detected and undone. It works in principle. But the overhead is brutal: it can take a great many physical qubits to build a single trustworthy logical qubit.

```text
  what an algorithm wants:        what hardware gives:

   [logical qubit]      built from     [phys][phys][phys]
   stable, reliable    ◄───────────    [phys][phys][phys]   noisy
                                        [phys][phys] ...     many of them
```

*What just happened:* the qubit counts in headlines are almost always *physical* qubits - the noisy kind. The qubits an algorithm like Shor's actually needs are *logical* qubits, and each one costs many physical qubits to build. That gap is why "we have N qubits" doesn't translate into "we can run the famous algorithms."

**NISQ: where we actually are.** Today's machines are described as **NISQ** - Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum. *Noisy*, because they don't yet have full error correction. *Intermediate-scale*, because they have enough qubits to be interesting but not enough error-corrected ones to break RSA or solve a problem of real commercial value that a classical computer can't. They're genuine, valuable research instruments - not yet the world-changing machines of the headlines.

## The honest takeaway

- Real, dramatic advantage exists for a **narrow** set of problems - Shor's factoring (exponential-class, threatening RSA-style crypto) and Grover's search (a square-root speedup).
- The world is already moving to **post-quantum cryptography** to stay ahead of the factoring threat.
- For **most** computing, quantum offers no speedup at all. It's a specialized tool, not a faster everything-machine.
- The hardware is held back by **decoherence** and **error rates**, demanding **error correction** that costs many physical qubits per logical qubit, which is why today's **NISQ** machines can't yet run the famous algorithms at threatening scale.

Keep both halves of the story and you'll never be fooled by a headline again. A quantum computer is a real, deep, genuinely strange machine - an interference engine that wins big in a few places and stays quiet everywhere else. The wonder is real. The magic box was never real. That's the whole guide.
