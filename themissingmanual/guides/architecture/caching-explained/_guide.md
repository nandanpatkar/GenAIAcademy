# Caching, Explained

"We should cache that" always sounds like the easy win — the magic word that makes slow things fast. Then a user swears they updated their profile and the old name keeps showing, and suddenly caching is the reason something is *wrong*, not fast. Both moments come from the same small idea, and once you hold it clearly, caching stops being a black box.

A cache is one thing: a copy of an expensive answer, kept somewhere fast, so you don't have to produce that answer again. Everything else — CDNs, Redis, browser caches, TTLs, the famous invalidation jokes — is a variation on that single move. This guide builds the idea up cleanly so you can reason about any cache you meet, instead of memorizing rules.

## How to read this

- **Want it to finally make sense?** Read in order. Phase 1 installs the mental model, Phase 2 shows you where caches actually live, and Phase 3 covers the part everyone gets bitten by.
- **Already comfortable and here for the hard part?** Jump to [Phase 3: The Hard Part — Invalidation & Staleness](03-invalidation-and-staleness.md) — that's where stale data, TTLs, and eviction live.

## The phases

1. **[What a Cache Actually Is](01-what-a-cache-actually-is.md)** — a copy of an expensive answer kept somewhere fast; hits, misses, and the notepad mental model.
2. **[Where Caches Live](02-where-caches-live.md)** — the browser, the CDN at the edge, your application cache (in-memory / Redis), and the database's own caches; a request traveling through all of them.
3. **[The Hard Part — Invalidation & Staleness](03-invalidation-and-staleness.md)** — why the cached copy and the truth drift apart, TTLs, eviction (LRU), write-through vs. cache-aside, and when *not* to cache.

> This guide stays at the "reason about it" level. Cache stampedes, distributed cache coherence, and tuning Redis for production are deliberately left for a follow-up — you want the mental model solid before any of that helps.
