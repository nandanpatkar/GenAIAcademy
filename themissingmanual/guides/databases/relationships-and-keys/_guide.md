# Relationships & Keys (Primary & Foreign)

You've seen a database table — rows and columns, like a spreadsheet. Then someone tells you the real
data is spread across *five* tables that all point at each other, and you have to "join" them back
together to get a useful answer. It feels like someone took one clean sheet and shattered it on purpose.

They did, actually — and there's a good reason. Splitting data into linked tables is what keeps it from
slowly rotting into a mess of contradictions. The links between those tables are made of two simple
ideas: **primary keys** and **foreign keys**. Once you see what they are and why they exist, the whole
"why is my data in pieces?" question dissolves, and [JOINs](/guides/sql-joins-explained) — the thing
that scares everyone next — turns out to be the easy part.

This guide assumes you already know what a table is. If "table," "row," and "column" are fuzzy, read
[What a Database Is](/guides/what-a-database-is) first, then come back.

## How to read this

- **Want it to finally make sense?** Read in order. Each phase builds the next: the problem (Phase 1),
  the anchor that names a row (Phase 2), and the link that connects rows across tables (Phase 3).
- **Just need keys defined?** [Phase 2: Primary Keys](02-primary-keys.md) and
  [Phase 3: Foreign Keys & Referential Integrity](03-foreign-keys-and-referential-integrity.md) stand on
  their own — but Phase 1 is what makes them feel inevitable instead of arbitrary.

## The phases

1. **[Why Split Data Into Tables](01-why-split-data-into-tables.md)** — the duplication problem: one big
   table repeats everything and rots. The fix is separate tables that reference each other.
2. **[Primary Keys](02-primary-keys.md)** — every row needs one stable, unique name the rest of the
   database can point at. What makes a good one, and why auto-numbers usually win.
3. **[Foreign Keys & Referential Integrity](03-foreign-keys-and-referential-integrity.md)** — a column
   that points at another table's primary key. How it models one-to-many and many-to-many, and how the
   database refuses to let your links break.

> Deeper modeling territory — the formal normal forms, indexing strategy, and composite-key design — is
> deliberately left for later guides. Here we build the intuition that everything else stands on.
