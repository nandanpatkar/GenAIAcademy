# Secrets Management (Don't Commit Your Keys)

There's a moment that happens to almost every developer once. You wire up a third-party service, paste the API key right into the code to "get it working," push the branch - and three days later get an email from your cloud provider about a $4,000 bill, or a note from a security bot that found your key in a public repo. You weren't careless, exactly. Nobody ever showed you where keys are *supposed* to live, so you put it where the code could see it.

This guide fixes that gap. By the end you'll know exactly what counts as a secret, why secrets leak (it's almost always the same way), how to keep them out of your code and out of Git, and how real teams store and rotate them so a leak is a shrug instead of a disaster. The core idea is calm and simple: **a secret is a key to something that costs money or data, so you treat it like a key - you don't tape it to the front door.**

## How to read this

- **You leaked a secret right now and need to act?** Jump to the [leaked-secret cheat-card in Phase 3](03-real-secrets-management.md) and follow it top to bottom. Then come back and read the rest when your heart rate is normal.
- **Want it to finally make sense?** Read in order. Each phase builds on the one before, starting with the mental model that makes every rule afterward obvious.

## The phases

1. **[What Counts as a Secret & Why It Leaks](01-what-counts-as-a-secret.md)** - the mental model (a secret is a key to something that costs money or data), the four kinds you'll meet, and the number-one way they escape: hardcoded into source and committed.
2. **[Keep Them Out of Code](02-keep-them-out-of-code.md)** - config via environment variables and `.env`, `.gitignore` and `.env.example`, pre-commit secret scanners, and the hard truth that a committed secret lives in Git history forever - so you rotate it.
3. **[Real Secrets Management](03-real-secrets-management.md)** - how teams do it for production: a secrets manager that stores keys centrally, encrypted and access-controlled; injecting them at runtime instead of baking them into images; least privilege; and making rotation routine. Includes the leaked-secret cheat-card.

> This guide is about keeping secrets *safe*. Where config values *come from* in the first place - environment variables, `.env`, YAML, precedence - is its own guide: [Environment Variables & Config](/guides/env-vars-and-config). And if a secret has already reached a remote and you're wondering whether `git revert` hides it (it doesn't), see [Git Disaster Recovery](/guides/git-disaster-recovery).
