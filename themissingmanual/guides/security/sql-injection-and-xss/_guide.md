# SQL Injection & XSS, Explained

You've heard both names a hundred times - they sit near the top of every security checklist - and you've
probably nodded along without ever being shown what's *actually* going wrong underneath. That's the gap
this guide closes. The reassuring part: SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting are not two unrelated
monsters. They're the *same* bug wearing two costumes, and once you see the shared cause, both fixes stop
feeling like memorized rules and start feeling obvious.

The one idea: an injection bug happens when something you *meant* as plain data - a username, a comment, a
search term - gets handed to a machine that reads it as **instructions** instead. A database that reads your
input as SQL. A browser that reads your input as HTML and JavaScript. The cure, in both cases, is the same
sentence: **keep data as data, so it can never be mistaken for code.**

We'll explain each hole the way a careful teammate would: enough of the mechanism to truly understand it,
then the real, production-grade fix.

## How to read this

- **Want to actually understand why these bugs exist?** Read in order. Phase 1 installs the one mental model
  both holes share; Phases 2 and 3 each take one hole and close it for good.
- **Already know the theory and just need the fix?** Jump to [Phase 2: SQL Injection](02-sql-injection.md)
  for parameterized queries, or [Phase 3: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](03-cross-site-scripting.md) for
  output encoding and CSP.

## The phases

1. **[The One Bug Underneath Both: Mixing Data with Code](01-the-one-bug-underneath-both.md)** - the unifying
   mental model. Injection is what happens when input is read as code; the fix is always "keep data as data."
2. **[SQL Injection](02-sql-injection.md)** - how a string-built query lets input rewrite the query's
   meaning, what an attacker gets, and the real fix: parameterized queries / prepared statements.
3. **[Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](03-cross-site-scripting.md)** - how untrusted input rendered into a page
   runs as script in other people's browsers, the damage it does, and the real fix: context-aware output
   encoding, auto-escaping templates, and a Content-Security-Policy.
