# Headers Are a Fence, Not a Lock

Here's the thing nobody tells you up front: a security header is not something *your server* enforces. It's an instruction your server hands to the *browser*, and the browser does the enforcing. You're not building a wall around your code - you're whispering to every visitor's browser, *"by the way, refuse to do these dangerous things while you're on my site."* Once that clicks, the whole topic stops feeling like arbitrary checklist items and starts feeling like what it is: a set of opt-in safety rules you switch on.

## What a security header actually is

A security header is a line in your HTTP *response* - the same response that carries your HTML. The browser reads it before it does anything risky.

```console
$ curl -I https://example.com
HTTP/2 200
content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8
strict-transport-security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
x-content-type-options: nosniff
content-security-policy: default-src 'self'
referrer-policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```
*What just happened:* `curl -I` asked only for the response headers (no body). Everything after `content-type` is a security header - each one a rule the server is asking the browser to follow. The server isn't *blocking* anything here; it's delegating enforcement to whatever browser loads the page.

That delegation is the whole mental model. The browser is already the most security-aware program on a user's machine - it sandboxes tabs, isolates origins, manages cookies. Security headers tap into that existing machinery and tell it, *"turn the dial up for this site."*

## Why this is the cheapest defense you have

Most security work is expensive: auditing code, rotating secrets, patching dependencies, writing tests for attack paths. Headers are different. They're a few lines of config, set once, applied to every response - and they defend against attacks you can't fully prevent in code.

That last part matters. You will never write a web app with zero bugs. Some day a piece of user input will slip through and end up in your HTML unescaped. That's a cross-site scripting (XSS) bug, and it's the kind of mistake every team makes eventually. A good Content-Security-Policy means that even when that bug exists, the injected script may not be allowed to *run*. The header doesn't fix the bug - it contains the blast radius.

💡 **This is defense in depth.** You don't pick *either* clean code *or* headers. You layer them. The code is the lock on the door; the headers are the fence around the yard. When the lock fails - and locks fail - the fence is still standing.

## What headers can and can't do

Be honest with yourself about the limits, because over-trusting a header is its own kind of bug.

```text
  Security header says:  "Browser, don't do X."
                          │
            ┌─────────────┴─────────────┐
            ▼                            ▼

  Your users are protected.    attacker's own tool
                               doesn't care at all.
```
*What just happened:* the diagram splits the world in two. Headers protect *people using browsers* - which is most of your users, most of the time. They do nothing against a tool that simply ignores them. An attacker hitting your API directly with a script never sees your CSP and doesn't care.

So headers are not a substitute for server-side checks. They don't replace authentication, input validation, or authorization. If an endpoint shouldn't be public, headers won't hide it. What headers *do* is protect your legitimate users from a hostile page, a hijacked dependency, or your own injection bug - the attacks that happen *inside* the victim's browser.

⚠️ **Don't let a green scanner score lull you.** Passing a "security headers" grading site means your fence is up. It says nothing about the lock on the door. Plenty of A+ header scores sit in front of wide-open auth bugs. Headers are *a* layer, not *the* layer.

## Where they fit in the bigger picture

Two of these headers lean directly on transport security and origin rules you may already know. HSTS only makes sense once you understand HTTPS - it's the header that forces it - so the connection layer in [HTTPS & TLS](/guides/https-and-tls) is the ground this stands on. And several headers (CSP's `connect-src`, the cookie `SameSite` flag) overlap with the cross-origin rules covered in [CORS, Explained](/guides/cors-explained). They're cousins: CORS governs which origins may *read* your responses; these headers govern what a page may *do* and *load*.

If you want the bird's-eye view of which attacks matter most, [OWASP Top 10](/guides/owasp-top-10) is the standard list - and you'll notice headers in this guide map straight onto several entries on it (injection, security misconfiguration, broken access control's cousins).

**For builders:** set headers in one place, not per-route. A single middleware or a reverse-proxy (nginx, Caddy) block that stamps every response is far easier to reason about - and audit - than headers scattered across handlers. Centralize, then you only have one thing to get right.

## Recap

1. A security header is an instruction in your HTTP *response* that the **browser** enforces on your behalf - you delegate, the browser does the work.
2. They're the **cheapest high-leverage defense** available: a few lines of config that close off whole attack categories and contain the damage when your code has a bug.
3. They are **defense in depth** - a fence around the lock, not a replacement for it.
4. They protect **people in browsers**, not against scripts and tools that ignore them - so never let a header stand in for real server-side auth and validation.

    "q": "Why are security headers called 'defense in depth' rather than a primary fix?",
    "choices": ["They are the only defense a site needs", "They replace authentication entirely", "They add a layer that contains damage when your code has a bug, without fixing the bug", "They make the server faster"],
    "answer": 2,
    "explain": "Headers don't fix bugs like XSS; they limit the blast radius when a bug slips through - a layer on top of the code's own defenses."
