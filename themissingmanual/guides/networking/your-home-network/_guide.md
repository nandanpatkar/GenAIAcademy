# Your Home Network, Explained

There's a box (maybe two) blinking on a shelf in your home, and every device you own depends on it. Most
people have no idea what it does - they only meet it when the internet dies and someone says "have you
tried restarting the router?" You don't need to fear it. By the end of this guide you'll know what each
box is, why all your gadgets have those funny `192.168.x.x` addresses, and the handful of settings that
keep strangers off your network. Nothing here is magic, and none of it is hard once you can see the shape
of it.

## How to read this
- **Just want it to make sense?** Read in order - each phase builds on the last. Three short reads and the
  whole box stops being mysterious.
- **Here to fix or secure something fast?** Phase 3 has the practical security checklist, and there's a
  troubleshooting nudge at the very end.

## The phases
1. **[The Router (and the Modem)](01-the-router-and-the-modem.md)** - the two boxes and what each one
   actually does: the modem connects you to your ISP; the router shares that one connection with all your
   devices.
2. **[NAT & Private IPs](02-nat-and-private-ips.md)** - why your devices all start with `192.168`, how
   they share a single public address, and why you can reach the internet but the internet can't reach
   straight into your laptop.
3. **[Wi-Fi & Keeping It Safe](03-wifi-and-keeping-it-safe.md)** - SSIDs, 2.4 vs 5 GHz, the router's
   firewall, and the few security settings that genuinely matter.

> Deeper material - port forwarding, running your own server, VPNs, mesh systems, and IPv6 - is left for
> follow-up guides. This one is about understanding the box you already have.
