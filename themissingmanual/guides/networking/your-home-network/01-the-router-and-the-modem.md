# The Router (and the Modem)

Picture the box (or boxes) that your home internet runs through. People use "the router," "the modem," and
"the Wi-Fi" as if they're the same thing. They're not - and the moment you can tell them apart, half the
confusion about home networking falls away. There are two jobs being done here, and sometimes one box does
both. Let's name the jobs first, then look at the boxes.

## The two jobs, in one picture

Here's the whole setup, from your couch to the wider internet:

  router[ROUTER<br/>shares one connection<br/>among devices]
  router --> modem[MODEM<br/>connects you to the ISP]
  modem --> isp[ISP<br/>your internet company]
  isp --> net((internet<br/>everything else))
```

The **modem** is the box that talks to your **ISP** (your internet company - Comcast, BT, your local
provider). The **router** is the box that takes that one connection and shares it among everything in your
home. Read on for what each one really does.

📝 **Terminology.** *ISP* = Internet Service Provider - the company you pay for internet. They own the wire
(or fiber, or coax cable) that runs from the street to your home.

## The modem - your bridge to the ISP

**What it actually is.** The modem is a translator. The signal your ISP sends down the line - over coax
cable, a phone line, or fiber - isn't something your laptop can read directly. The modem converts that
signal into plain network data your devices understand, and converts your devices' data back into
something the line can carry. That's its entire job: one connection in from the ISP, one connection out to
your network.

📝 **Terminology.** *Modem* is short for *modulator–demodulator* - it modulates (encodes) your data onto
the line and demodulates (decodes) what comes back. The name is the job.

**What it does in real life.** The modem is the single point where your home meets the wider internet. If
the modem is offline, nothing in your home can reach the internet, no matter how healthy your Wi-Fi looks.
This is why "is the modem's light solid?" is the first question a support agent asks.

**The gotcha.** ⚠️ A modem alone connects exactly *one* device. Plug a laptop straight into a bare modem
and that laptop gets online - but nothing else does, and there's no Wi-Fi. The modem doesn't share. To get
many devices online and to get wireless, you need the second box: the router.

## The router - the manager of your home network

**What it actually is.** The router is the manager of everything inside your home. It takes the single
internet connection coming from the modem and shares it among all your devices - wired and wireless. It
hands each device a local address, keeps track of who asked for what, and makes sure replies from the
internet get back to the right device. It also (in almost every home router) broadcasts the Wi-Fi.

📝 **Terminology.** The network the router creates inside your home is your *LAN* - Local Area Network. The
big network on the other side of the modem is the internet, sometimes called the *WAN* (Wide Area
Network). The router sits exactly on the border between them.

**What it does in real life.** Every device you own connects to the router, not to the modem. Your phone,
laptop, smart TV, and the speaker in the kitchen all talk to the router; the router talks to the modem; the
modem talks to the ISP. When your TV streams a show, the request walks out that chain and the video walks
back in along the same path.

**A real example.** On most home networks you can ask your own machine which box is its router. Here's what
that looks like:

```console
$ ipconfig getoption en0 router
192.168.1.1
```
*What just happened:* Your laptop reported the address of its router - `192.168.1.1` here. That's the box
your device sends everything to when it wants to reach the outside world. This address is called the
**default gateway** ("the way out"), and it's almost always the address you'd type into a browser to open
the router's own settings page. (On Windows the command is `ipconfig`; look for the "Default Gateway" line.
On Linux, `ip route` shows it after the word `default`.)

📝 **Terminology.** *Default gateway* = the device your computer hands traffic to when the destination isn't
on your local network. For a home network, that's your router.

**The gotcha.** ⚠️ Many ISPs now ship a single box that's a modem *and* a router combined - a "gateway."
That's convenient, but it's why people mix the two jobs up: they've only ever seen one box. The jobs are
still separate inside it. When you're troubleshooting, ask yourself which job is failing - "can't reach the
ISP" (modem job) is a different problem from "my devices can't talk to each other or get addresses" (router
job).

**Why this saves you later.** When the internet goes down, you can reason instead of panic. No internet on
*any* device, modem light dark? That points at the modem or the ISP. Internet works on a cable but Wi-Fi
won't connect? That's the router's wireless side. The classic "restart the router" advice works because it
makes the router rebuild its picture of your network from scratch - and now you know what that picture is.

## Recap

1. **The modem** translates your ISP's signal into network data and is the single bridge between your home
   and the internet. On its own it connects only one device.
2. **The router** shares that one connection among all your devices, hands out local addresses, and
   broadcasts your Wi-Fi. It's the manager of your home network (your **LAN**).
3. The **default gateway** is your device's name for the router - the box it sends traffic to on the way
   out.
4. Many ISPs combine both into one **gateway** box, but the two jobs are still distinct - which matters the
   moment something breaks.

Next we'll open up the router's cleverest trick: how it lets a dozen devices share a single internet
address without ever getting their wires crossed.
