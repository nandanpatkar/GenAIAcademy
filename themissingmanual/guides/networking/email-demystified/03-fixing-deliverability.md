# Fixing Deliverability

You added an SPF record. You're still in spam. This is the moment most people give up and blame "the algorithm." But deliverability failures are almost never mysterious - they're a short list of specific, checkable mistakes. This phase is the cure: why mail still fails after a partial setup, how to read the report that tells you the truth, and a checklist you can run today.

## The number one cause: alignment, not authentication

Here's the trap that catches nearly everyone. You set up SPF. Your mail *passes SPF*. And it still fails DMARC, because passing isn't enough - it has to **align**.

Remember from Phase 2: SPF checks the hidden `MAIL FROM` envelope address, not the visible `From:`. When you send through a vendor, the envelope often belongs to *the vendor's* domain, while your `From:` says `you@yourcompany.com`. SPF passes - for the vendor - but the domains don't match, so DMARC sees a misalignment and fails.

```text
Envelope MAIL FROM:  bounce@mail.somevendor.com   <- SPF passes for THIS
Visible   From:      you@yourcompany.com           <- DMARC checks alignment to THIS
Result:   SPF=pass, but SPF-alignment=fail
```

*What just happened:* SPF gave a green light to the vendor's domain, but DMARC asks "does the authenticated domain match the From: domain?" and the answer is no. The fix is **DKIM** - sign with `d=yourcompany.com` and DKIM aligns to your visible `From:` regardless of whose servers relayed it. This is exactly why DKIM is non-negotiable, not optional.

## Read the report - it tells you who's failing

DMARC's `rua=` address gets you a daily XML report from every major receiver. It's ugly raw, but it answers the only question that matters: *which of my sending sources are passing, and which are failing?* Trimmed to the human-readable core, one record looks like this:

```text
source_ip:        198.51.100.24
header_from:      yourcompany.com
count:            42
spf:   result=pass   domain=mail.somevendor.com   aligned=no
dkim:  result=pass   domain=yourcompany.com        aligned=yes
disposition:      none   (DMARC overall: PASS via DKIM)
```

*What just happened:* 42 messages came from one source. SPF passed but *didn't align* (vendor's domain). DKIM passed *and aligned* to `yourcompany.com`. Because DMARC needs only one aligned pass, the overall verdict is PASS - saved by DKIM. If both `aligned` columns said `no`, you'd see your policy applied and your real mail getting quarantined. The report is how you find the *one* sending source you forgot to set up DKIM for.

> Reading raw DMARC XML by hand is miserable. Point your `rua` at a free or paid DMARC report aggregator - it turns the XML into a dashboard of "source X is failing." That's the single highest-leverage move for diagnosing deliverability.

## Roll out DMARC safely - don't start at reject

A common self-inflicted outage: publishing `p=reject` on day one. If any legitimate sending source isn't fully set up - a CRM, an old script, a billing system you forgot - its mail gets *rejected* the moment you flip the switch. Roll out in stages:

```text
Week 1+:  p=none        <- monitor only; collect reports, change nothing
Then:     p=quarantine  <- once reports show all real sources passing
Finally:  p=reject      <- when you're confident every source is aligned
```

*What just happened:* `p=none` lets you watch reality through the reports without affecting delivery. You only tighten to `quarantine` and then `reject` after the reports confirm every legitimate source authenticates and aligns. The reports are your runway; don't take off blind.

## Beyond the three records

Authentication gets you *eligible* for the inbox; it doesn't guarantee it. A few things still move the needle:

- **Reputation.** Receivers track how your domain and sending IP behave over time. New domains and IPs start cold and must warm up with consistent, wanted mail.
- **Content and lists.** Spammy subject lines, image-only emails, and sending to people who never opted in all push you toward spam regardless of perfect records.
- **PTR / reverse DNS.** If you run your own sending server, its IP should have a reverse DNS record matching its hostname. Mismatches look suspicious.
- **TLS.** Modern receivers expect mail over encrypted connections; bare port 25 with no TLS reads as old or sketchy.

Authentication is the floor, not the ceiling - but without it, nothing else matters, because you can't even prove you're you.

## The working checklist

Run this top to bottom for any domain that sends mail:

```text
[ ] MX record points to your real mail host
[ ] SPF: one TXT record, lists every sending source, ends in ~all or -all
[ ] SPF: under 10 DNS lookups (no permerror)
[ ] DKIM: public key published per vendor selector (s=...)
[ ] DKIM: vendor is actually signing with d=yourdomain.com
[ ] DMARC: _dmarc record exists with rua= reporting address
[ ] DMARC: started at p=none, watching reports before tightening
[ ] Reports: every legitimate source shows an aligned pass
[ ] Then and only then: move p= to quarantine, then reject
```

*What just happened:* you turned a vague "fix my email" into nine verifiable steps. Each line is checkable in DNS or in a report - no guessing, no blaming the algorithm.

## For builders

Bake this into onboarding, not firefighting. When your app adds a new way to send mail, the pull request that wires up the vendor should also note the SPF `include:`, the DKIM selector, and a check of the next DMARC report. Treat the three records as part of "shipping email," the same way you'd treat a database migration as part of shipping a feature. The teams that never think about deliverability are the ones who built it in from the start.

```quiz
[
  {
    "q": "Your mail passes SPF but still fails DMARC. What's the most likely cause?",
    "choices": ["Port 25 is blocked", "SPF passed for the vendor's domain, which doesn't align with your visible From: - and DKIM isn't set up to fix it", "The recipient's server is down", "Your MX record is missing"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "SPF checks the envelope domain, often the vendor's. Without aligned DKIM signing as your domain, DMARC sees a mismatch and fails."
  },
  {
    "q": "Why start a DMARC rollout at p=none instead of p=reject?",
    "choices": ["p=none is more secure", "p=none lets you collect reports and confirm every legitimate source passes before any mail gets blocked", "reject doesn't work on most servers", "none enables encryption"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "p=none is monitor-only. It gives you a safe window to find unconfigured sending sources via reports before tightening to quarantine and reject."
  },
  {
    "q": "What does the DMARC aggregate report (rua) most usefully tell you?",
    "choices": ["The content of each email", "Which of your sending sources are passing or failing authentication and alignment", "The recipients' passwords", "Your server's CPU usage"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "The report breaks delivery down by source IP, showing SPF/DKIM results and alignment - so you can pinpoint the source you forgot to configure."
  }
]
