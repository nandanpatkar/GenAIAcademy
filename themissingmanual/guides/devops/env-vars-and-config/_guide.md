# Environment Variables & Config (.env, YAML)

You cloned a project, ran it, and it died with `Error: DATABASE_URL is not set`. Or you opened a repo
and found a file called `config.yaml`, a file called `.env.example`, and a warning in the README saying
**never commit your `.env`** — with no explanation of why. None of this was ever taught to you; it just
showed up in every project and you were expected to already know.

This guide makes it knowable. By the end you'll understand what a config file *actually does*, why your
settings live outside your code in the first place, what an environment variable really is, and how the
common config formats (YAML and friends) work — including the indentation trap in YAML that bites
everyone exactly once.

## How to read this

- **Just need to get a project running?** Skim [Phase 2: Environment Variables & .env Files](02-env-vars-and-dotenv.md)
  — it covers reading variables and the `.env` file most projects expect.
- **Want it to finally make sense?** Read in order. Each phase builds on the one before, starting with
  the mental model that makes the rest obvious.

## The phases

1. **[Why Config Lives Outside Code](01-why-config-lives-outside-code.md)** — the same app runs on your
   laptop, on staging, and in production with different settings; config is how you separate
   what-changes-per-environment from the code itself.
2. **[Environment Variables & .env Files](02-env-vars-and-dotenv.md)** — what an environment variable
   actually is, how to read one from the shell and from code, and how `.env` files make local
   development sane (and why you must never commit them).
3. **[Config Files: YAML & Friends](03-config-files-yaml.md)** — YAML, JSON, and TOML for structured
   config, the YAML indentation gotcha, and the precedence order that decides which setting wins.

> Deeper material — *how* to store production secrets safely (vaults, encrypted secrets, cloud secret
> managers) — lives in its own guide: [Secrets Management](/guides/secrets-management). This guide gets
> you to the point where you understand *why* secrets belong in config and out of Git.
