# Environment Variables & .env Files

You've seen them in READMEs (`export API_KEY=...`), in error messages (`DATABASE_URL is not set`), and in
that mysterious `.env` file everyone has but nobody explains. Environment variables are the single most
common way config reaches a running program, and once you see what they actually are, they stop being
magic. Let's make them ordinary.

## What an environment variable actually is

**What it actually is.** An **environment variable** is a `NAME=value` pair that the operating system
keeps for a running program and its children. When your program starts, it inherits a little bag of these
pairs — its **environment** — and it can look any of them up by name. That's the whole concept: named
values handed to a process from the outside.

```text
   ┌──────────── the process's environment ────────────┐
   │  DATABASE_URL = postgres://localhost:5432/myapp    │
   │  LOG_LEVEL    = debug                              │
   │  API_KEY      = sk_test_abc123                     │
   │  PATH         = /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin       │
   └────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
            │  your program reads these by name
            ▼
        "give me DATABASE_URL"  →  "postgres://localhost:5432/myapp"
```

📝 **Terminology.** The convention is **ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES** for the name — not an OS rule, but
every project follows it. The value is always text (a string); even a "number" like a port is stored as
the characters `"5432"`.

**Why people get this wrong.** People assume environment variables are something Python or Node invented.
They're not — they're an operating-system feature that predates all of them. Your shell has them, every
program has them, and that `PATH` variable that tells your terminal where to find commands is the same
mechanism. Frameworks just give you a convenient way to *read* them.

## Reading a variable from the shell

The fastest way to see one is from your terminal. On macOS or Linux, `echo` prints a value and `$NAME`
asks the shell for that variable:

```console
$ echo $HOME
/home/ada
```
*What just happened:* The shell looked up the `HOME` variable — which the OS set for you at login — and
substituted its value, then `echo` printed it. `HOME` is one your system always sets; it points at your
user folder.

Ask for one that isn't set, and you get nothing — an empty line, not an error:

```console
$ echo $DATABASE_URL

```
*What just happened:* `DATABASE_URL` isn't set in this shell, so `$DATABASE_URL` expanded to *nothing*,
and `echo` printed a blank line. This is the root of those `is not set` errors: the program asked for a
variable, the OS had nothing, and the program gave up.

⚠️ **Gotcha — Windows is different.** `echo $VAR` is Unix-shell syntax (bash, zsh). On **PowerShell** the
same lookup is `echo $env:HOME`; in the old **Command Prompt** it's `echo %HOME%`. The concept is
identical everywhere — only the reading syntax differs.

You can set one for the current shell session like this (Unix):

```console
$ export LOG_LEVEL=debug
$ echo $LOG_LEVEL
debug
```
*What just happened:* `export` created `LOG_LEVEL` and marked it so programs launched *from this shell*
inherit it. No spaces around the `=`, and it's **temporary** — it lives only until you close this
terminal. That temporariness is exactly the problem `.env` files solve, coming up.

## Reading a variable from your code

Every language has a built-in way to read the environment. You don't import a library for this part — the
variables are just *there* for any program. A few of the common ones:

```text
   Python      os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]        # or os.environ.get(...) for a safe default
   Node.js     process.env.DATABASE_URL
   Ruby        ENV["DATABASE_URL"]
   Go          os.Getenv("DATABASE_URL")
   Rust        std::env::var("DATABASE_URL")
```

Here's the shape it takes in practice (Python), and what it does when you run it:

```console
$ export GREETING=hello
$ python3 -c "import os; print(os.environ.get('GREETING', 'default'))"
hello
$ python3 -c "import os; print(os.environ.get('MISSING', 'default'))"
default
```
*What just happened:* The first call read `GREETING` from the environment we just exported. The second
asked for `MISSING`, which we never set — but because we used `.get()` with a fallback of `'default'`, it
printed that instead of crashing. That fallback pattern is how you give a setting a sensible default while
still letting the environment override it.

⚠️ **Gotcha — everything is a string.** A variable read from the environment is always text. Set
`PORT=8080` and need a number? Convert it (`int(os.environ["PORT"])` in Python) — forgetting this gives
confusing errors like trying to do math on the string `"8080"`.

## `.env` files — sane local development

**Why people get this wrong.** Setting variables by hand with `export` works, but it's miserable daily:
the values vanish when you close the terminal, and a real app might need a dozen of them. Nobody wants to
re-type twelve `export` lines every morning. There's a standard fix.

**What it actually is.** A **`.env` file** (pronounced "dot-env") is a plain text file in your project,
one `NAME=value` per line, that a small library loads into the environment when your app starts. It's a
convenience: instead of exporting variables by hand, you write them down once.

A typical `.env` looks like this:

```text
DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost:5432/myapp_dev
LOG_LEVEL=debug
API_KEY=sk_test_abc123
PORT=8080
```

To load it, you add a tiny library — `python-dotenv` for Python, `dotenv` for Node, and so on. In Python:

```console
$ pip install python-dotenv
$ python3 -c "from dotenv import load_dotenv; import os; load_dotenv(); print(os.environ['LOG_LEVEL'])"
debug
```
*What just happened:* `load_dotenv()` found the `.env` file, read each line, and placed those pairs into
the process environment — exactly as if you'd `export`ed each by hand. `os.environ['LOG_LEVEL']` then
reads `debug` from the file. Your code doesn't change; it still just reads environment variables. The
`.env` file only *populates* them.

💡 **Key point.** The `.env` file is a **development** convenience. In staging and production you usually
*don't* ship one — the hosting platform (or container, or secrets manager) sets the real environment
variables directly. Your code reads `os.environ[...]` the same way everywhere; only the *source* of those
values changes. That's the payoff from [Phase 1](01-why-config-lives-outside-code.md): one codebase,
different surroundings.

## ⚠️ Never commit your `.env`

This is the rule that gets its own heading because getting it wrong is genuinely costly.

Your `.env` file holds the real values for *your* machine — and on real projects, that includes
**secrets**: API keys, database passwords, tokens. Commit it to Git and those secrets go into the
repository's history, visible to everyone with access and effectively impossible to erase (deleting the
file in a later commit doesn't remove it from history).

So you tell Git to ignore it. Add this one line to a file named `.gitignore` in your project:

```text
.env
```

Then confirm Git is actually ignoring it:

```console
$ git status
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```
*What just happened:* Even though `.env` exists on disk, it doesn't appear in `git status` — `.gitignore`
told Git to pretend it isn't there, so you can't accidentally stage or commit it. If `.env` *did* show up,
it isn't ignored yet — fix that before your next commit.

📝 **The `.env.example` convention.** Since `.env` itself is secret and uncommitted, projects commit a
companion **`.env.example`** instead — it lists the *names* every variable needs, with fake or blank
values, so a new teammate knows what to fill in:

```text
DATABASE_URL=
LOG_LEVEL=debug
API_KEY=your_test_key_here
PORT=8080
```

When you clone a project, the ritual is: copy `.env.example` to `.env`, then fill in the real values.
That's the `is not set` error from the start of this guide, solved.

This is only the *first* layer of keeping secrets safe. Storing and distributing production secrets
properly (vaults, encrypted files, cloud secret managers) is its own topic: [Secrets
Management](/guides/secrets-management).

**Why this saves you later.** Reading config from the environment means the *same code* works on your
laptop with a `.env` file and in production with platform-injected variables — and keeping `.env` out of
Git means a leaked laptop or a public repo doesn't hand an attacker your production keys.

## Recap

1. An **environment variable** is a `NAME=value` pair the OS gives your running program; your code reads
   it by name (`os.environ`, `process.env`, `ENV[...]`, etc.).
2. Read one from the shell with `echo $NAME` (Unix), `$env:NAME` (PowerShell), or `%NAME%` (cmd). An
   unset variable reads as **empty**, which is what `is not set` errors come from.
3. Everything is a **string** — convert ports and numbers yourself.
4. A **`.env` file** loads many variables at once for local development; a small library reads it into the
   environment so your code doesn't change.
5. **Never commit `.env`** — add it to `.gitignore`. Commit a `.env.example` listing the variable names
   instead.

Next: when a handful of variables isn't enough and you need structured, nested config — YAML and friends.
