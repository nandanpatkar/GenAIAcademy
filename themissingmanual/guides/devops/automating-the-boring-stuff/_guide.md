# Automating the Boring Stuff (Ops Scripting)

You know the task. The one you do by hand every few days: copy these files, restart that service, run these four commands in this exact order, check the output, hope you didn't fat-finger step three. It works — until the day you're tired, or in a hurry, or someone else has to do it without you. Then it doesn't.

This guide is about turning those repeated manual chores into scripts. Not because scripting is fashionable, but because a script is faster, doesn't forget a step, and — the part nobody tells you — is *documentation that actually runs*. By the end you'll have a clear sense of when to automate (and when not to bother), a real bash script you can adapt, and an honest answer to "should this be Python instead?"

This is an intermediate guide. It assumes you're comfortable in a terminal — running commands, moving around directories, editing files. If that's still shaky, start with [The Terminal and Shell](/guides/the-terminal-and-shell) and come back.

## How to read this

- **Not sure whether something is even worth automating?** Read [Phase 1: If You've Done It Twice, Script It](01-if-youve-done-it-twice.md) — it's the decision, not the code.
- **Ready to write a real script?** Go straight to [Phase 2: Shell Scripting Essentials](02-shell-scripting-essentials.md) for an annotated, working example.
- **Want it to finally make sense?** Read in order — each phase builds on the last.

## The phases

1. **[If You've Done It Twice, Script It](01-if-youve-done-it-twice.md)** — the mindset. Why manual steps are slow, error-prone, and unrepeatable, why a script is documentation that runs, and the honest test for when automating is worth it (and when it isn't).
2. **[Shell Scripting Essentials](02-shell-scripting-essentials.md)** — a real bash script, built up piece by piece: variables, arguments, conditionals, loops, exit codes, and the one line (`set -euo pipefail`) that turns a silent disaster into a loud, safe failure.
3. **[When to Reach for Python](03-when-to-reach-for-python.md)** — the point where bash starts hurting (data structures, parsing, anything cross-platform), how to tell, and how to *schedule* your automation with cron so it runs without you — safely, because it's idempotent, logged, and dry-runnable.

> Deliberately deferred to follow-up guides: full configuration management (Ansible, etc.), CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure-as-code. This guide is about *your* repeated tasks — the scripts you write to save your own afternoons. Once those are second nature, the bigger tools make a lot more sense.
