# Security with Spring Security

Spring Security intimidates almost everyone. People who write JPA mappings and transactional services without breaking a sweat open the security config, see a wall of `.authorizeHttpRequests(...)` and `.hasRole(...)` and something called a "filter chain," and quietly back away. The reputation is earned — for years the API was genuinely awkward, and most tutorials hand you a magic blob of config without explaining the machine underneath.

Before a single line of config, here's the one idea that turns Spring Security from voodoo into something you can reason about:

> **Spring Security is a chain of servlet filters that every request passes through *before* it reaches your controller.**

That's the whole secret. Hold that picture and everything else in this phase falls into place.

## The filter chain — the mental model that fixes everything

📝 A **servlet filter** is a piece of code that wraps every incoming HTTP request *before* your controller runs. Spring Security installs a whole ordered **chain** of them. A request comes in and walks through the chain one filter at a time — each filter asks a single question and either lets the request continue or stops it cold.

The questions look like this, roughly in order:

- *Is this path public (like `/login` or `/public/**`)?* If so, wave it through.
- *Is there a session, a token, or login credentials attached?* If so, figure out **who** this is.
- *Now that we know who they are, are they **allowed** to hit this URL?* If not, reject with 403.

Only if the request survives every filter does it finally reach your `@RestController`. If any filter says no, the request is turned away right there — your controller code never even runs.

```mermaid

  Req[HTTP request] --> F1[Filter: public path?]
  F1 --> F2[Filter: extract credentials / token]
  F2 --> F3[Filter: authenticate -> who are you?]
  F3 --> F4[Filter: authorize -> are you allowed?]
  F4 -->|passes all| Ctrl[Your @RestController]
  F1 -.reject.-> Deny[401 / 403]
  F3 -.reject.-> Deny
  F4 -.reject.-> Deny
```

*What just happened:* The request runs a gauntlet of filters, each with one job, and only a request that clears all of them reaches your controller. This is why your controller almost never contains security code — by the time a request gets there, the chain has *already* decided it's authenticated and authorized. When you write a `SecurityFilterChain` bean, you're not writing magic; you're configuring *which filters run* and *what they check*. Every confusing config method maps back to one of those filter questions.

## Authentication vs authorization — two different questions

These two words sound alike, get abbreviated to the nearly-identical authN and authZ, and are constantly confused — including in production code that conflates them and ships a security hole. They are *not* the same question, and the filter chain treats them as separate steps for exactly that reason.

📝 **Authentication (authN) = "who are you?"** It's the login step: you prove your identity with a password, a token, an API key. The output is a verified identity (or a rejection). **Authorization (authZ) = "are you allowed to do this?"** It happens *after* authentication, and it checks whether the now-known user has permission for *this specific action* — usually via **roles** (`ADMIN`, `USER`) or finer-grained permissions.

A worked example makes the split obvious: logging into your bank's app is authentication — the app now knows it's you. Being told "you can view your own account but not transfer from someone else's" is authorization. You're fully authenticated the whole time; you're just not authorized for that one action. Mix these up — checking *that* someone is logged in but never *what* they're allowed to do — and any logged-in user can do anything. One of the most common real-world security bugs.

This distinction is foundational enough that it has its own dedicated guide: [Authentication vs Authorization](/guides/auth-vs-authz). For now, the rule to carry forward: **authenticate first (who), authorize second (what), never collapse the two.**

## Configuring access — the SecurityFilterChain bean

Time for config — and now it won't feel like magic, because you know it's just describing filter behavior. Modern Spring Security (6.x) is configured by declaring a `SecurityFilterChain` **bean** (the old `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` you'll see in stale tutorials is gone — ignore it). You're handed a builder and you describe which paths are public, which need any logged-in user, and which need a specific role.

```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.web.SecurityFilterChain;

@Configuration
public class SecurityConfig {

    @Bean
    public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> auth
                .requestMatchers("/public/**", "/login").permitAll()   // anyone
                .requestMatchers("/api/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")      // ADMIN role only
                .anyRequest().authenticated()                          // everything else: must be logged in
            )
            .httpBasic(basic -> {});   // accept HTTP Basic credentials for now

        return http.build();
    }
}
```

*What just happened:* `authorizeHttpRequests` is the **authorization filter** from our diagram, configured rule by rule. Rules are matched **top to bottom, first match wins**: `/public/**` and `/login` are open to everyone, `/api/admin/**` requires the `ADMIN` role, and `anyRequest().authenticated()` says every other path needs a logged-in user. ⚠️ Put specific rules *before* the broad `anyRequest()` catch-all — a catch-all placed too early swallows the rules below it. Also note: `hasRole("ADMIN")` looks for an authority named `ROLE_ADMIN` — Spring adds the `ROLE_` prefix for you, which trips up everyone once.

## Passwords & users — never store plaintext

Authorization rules are useless if anyone can log in as anyone. So the chain needs to *authenticate* — and that means storing and checking passwords. Here is the single most important rule in this entire phase, in bold because people still get it wrong:

📝 **Never store passwords as plaintext. Store a salted hash, and let a `PasswordEncoder` do it.** Spring's standard choice is **BCrypt**: a deliberately slow, salted hashing algorithm. When a user registers you store `encoder.encode(rawPassword)`; when they log in Spring calls `encoder.matches(rawInput, storedHash)`. The original password is never written down anywhere, so a database leak doesn't hand an attacker everyone's credentials. *Why* hashing (not encryption), *why* slow, and *why* salted is its own rich topic — see [How Passwords Are Stored](/guides/how-passwords-are-stored).

To teach the chain *where* your users live, you provide a `UserDetailsService` — a single method that loads a user by username and returns their stored hash plus their roles. Spring's authentication filter calls it, compares the password, and on success records who you are.

```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.User;
import org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.UserDetailsService;
import org.springframework.security.crypto.bcrypt.BCryptPasswordEncoder;
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder;

@Bean
public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
    return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();   // salted, deliberately slow
}

@Bean
public UserDetailsService users(PasswordEncoder encoder) {
    var admin = User.withUsername("admin")
        .password(encoder.encode("s3cret"))   // store the HASH, never the raw value
        .roles("ADMIN")                        // becomes authority ROLE_ADMIN
        .build();
    return new InMemoryUserDetailsManager(admin);
}
```

*What just happened:* The `PasswordEncoder` bean tells Spring to hash with BCrypt everywhere. `UserDetailsService` defines a single user whose password is *stored as a BCrypt hash*, not the raw string — when "admin" logs in, the filter hashes their input and compares hashes. `InMemoryUserDetailsManager` is perfect for a demo; a real app implements `UserDetailsService` to load users from your database via the repository pattern from [Phase 6](06-service-layer-and-validation.md). `.roles("ADMIN")` is what makes the earlier `hasRole("ADMIN")` rule match this user.

A quick word on the two built-in login styles you'll choose between. **HTTP Basic** (`httpBasic`) sends the username and password on *every* request in a header — dead simple, common for machine-to-machine APIs. **Form login** (`formLogin`) shows a login page, authenticates once, and tracks you with a session cookie afterward — the right fit for browser apps with human users.

⚠️ **None of this is safe without HTTPS.** HTTP Basic literally puts your password (base64-encoded, which is *not* encryption) in a header on every request; form login ships a session cookie around. Over plain HTTP, anyone on the network can read both. In production, terminate TLS and serve everything over HTTPS — non-negotiable. If "TLS" is fuzzy, [HTTPS and TLS](/guides/https-and-tls) explains exactly what it protects and how.

## Stateless APIs & JWT — the overview

The session-cookie model assumes the server *remembers* you between requests (it keeps session state in memory). For a REST API serving mobile apps and other services, that's often the wrong shape — you'd rather each request carry its own proof and the server remember nothing.

📝 **A stateless API carries identity on every request instead of relying on a server-side session.** The dominant approach is the **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: at login the server hands the client a signed token encoding who they are and when it expires; the client sends it back in an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header on every subsequent request. A custom filter (slotted right into the chain you already understand) validates the signature and expiry, and if it checks out, marks the request authenticated — *without any session lookup*.

```http
GET /api/orders HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1Ni
```

*What just happened:* The client attaches its token in the `Authorization` header. A JWT-validation filter near the front of the chain reads it, verifies the signature with the server's secret key, checks it hasn't expired, and — if valid — populates the authenticated identity so the authorization rules downstream can do their job. No session, no server-side memory of this user. That's the whole appeal: any server instance can validate the token, so you scale horizontally without sticky sessions.

We're deliberately *not* writing a full JWT implementation here, and you should be wary of any tutorial that casually does. ⚠️ The footguns are real: **where the client stores the token** (`localStorage` is XSS-exposed; `HttpOnly` cookies dodge that but invite CSRF), **expiry and revocation** (a stateless token can't be "logged out" server-side without extra machinery like a denylist or refresh tokens), and the cardinal sin — **rolling your own crypto or token parsing**. Use a vetted, maintained library (`jjwt` or Nimbus) and lean on it.

For finer control than URL rules give you, **method-level security** lets you guard individual methods. Enable it with `@EnableMethodSecurity` and annotate:

```java
@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")
public void deleteUser(Long id) { ... }
```

*What just happened:* `@PreAuthorize` runs its check *before* the method body executes — same authorization question as the URL rules, just expressed at the method instead of the path. It shines when authorization depends on the actual arguments (`@PreAuthorize("#id == authentication.name")` to let users act only on their own data), which URL patterns can't express.

💡 **Security is the worst possible place to be clever.** The framework's defaults — BCrypt, filter chain ordering, CSRF protection, vetted token libraries — encode years of hard-won lessons and patched vulnerabilities. Configure the battle-tested machine; don't reinvent it. The most secure code you'll write here is the code you *didn't* write.

## Recap

1. **The filter chain is the whole mental model.** Spring Security is an ordered chain of servlet filters every request passes *before* reaching your controller; each filter asks one question (public? authenticated? authorized?) and lets the request continue or stops it. Every config method maps back to a filter.
2. **AuthN ≠ authZ.** Authentication is "who are you?" (login); authorization is "are you allowed?" (roles/permissions), and it comes second. Conflating them — checking that someone's logged in but not what they can do — is a classic hole. See [Authentication vs Authorization](/guides/auth-vs-authz).
3. **Configure access with a `SecurityFilterChain` bean.** `permitAll()` for public paths, `authenticated()` for any logged-in user, `hasRole("ADMIN")` for role-gated paths. Rules match top-down, first match wins — put specifics before the `anyRequest()` catch-all.
4. **Never store plaintext passwords.** Use a `PasswordEncoder` (BCrypt: salted and slow), load users via a `UserDetailsService`, and pick HTTP Basic (machine APIs) or form login (browsers). ⚠️ All of it depends on HTTPS in production — see [How Passwords Are Stored](/guides/how-passwords-are-stored) and [HTTPS and TLS](/guides/https-and-tls).
5. **Stateless APIs use JWTs.** The client sends a signed token in `Authorization: Bearer ...` on each request; a filter validates it, no session needed. ⚠️ Mind token storage, expiry/revocation, and never roll your own crypto. `@PreAuthorize` adds method-level checks.
6. **Don't be clever with security.** Lean on the framework's battle-tested defaults; the safest code is the code the framework already wrote and patched for you.
