# What FastAPI Is & Your First App

You know Python and have maybe touched [REST APIs](/guides/rest-apis-explained). Now you want to
*serve* something over HTTP — a little book API that other programs can call. This guide covers the
framework that's become the default for new Python API projects: **FastAPI**.

Hold this in your head before any code: FastAPI's whole personality comes from one decision —
**your Python type hints are the source of truth.** Annotate a function with the types it expects, and
FastAPI reuses those same annotations to parse incoming requests, validate them, generate documentation,
and serialize what you send back. One thing you write; four jobs it does.

## What FastAPI actually is

📝 **FastAPI** — a modern, asynchronous Python web framework for building APIs. It stands on two
well-tested libraries: **Starlette** handles the web machinery (routing, requests, responses), and
**Pydantic** handles data validation. FastAPI wires them together around your type hints.

It speaks a protocol called **ASGI**, which explains the "async" in the name and the "fast" in the
brand.

📝 **WSGI vs ASGI** — WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) is the older Python standard: one request,
one worker, blocked until the work is done. ASGI (the *A* is for **Asynchronous**) is the modern
successor — it can handle a request, hit a slow database or external API, and *while waiting* go serve
other requests instead of sitting idle. Same idea as `async`/`await`, applied to a whole web server.

💡 If you've read [Python's async chapter](/guides/python-from-zero), this is where it pays off:
FastAPI lets your handlers be `async def`, so an app waiting on I/O can stay busy. Plain `def` handlers
work too — FastAPI runs them safely in a threadpool. You don't have to go async on day one.

## Install it and write your first app

One install. The `[standard]` extra pulls in the server and a few niceties you'll want immediately:

```bash
pip install "fastapi[standard]"
```

*What just happened:* you installed FastAPI plus its recommended companions — most importantly
**Uvicorn**, the ASGI server that listens on a port and runs your app. Quote the string; some shells
treat `[` and `]` as special characters otherwise.

Now the smallest app that does something. Create a file called `main.py`:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"message": "The book API is alive"}
```

*What just happened:* `app = FastAPI()` is your application object — the thing the server runs. The
`@app.get("/")` decorator says "when someone sends a `GET` request to the path `/`, run the function
below." Your function returns a plain Python `dict`, and FastAPI turns it into a JSON response — no
JSON library calls, no manual `Content-Type` header.

⚠️ Running `python main.py` won't start a server — this is app code, not a runnable script. FastAPI
apps need an ASGI server to run them. That's the next step.

Start the server with Uvicorn, pointing it at `main:app` (the `app` object inside `main.py`):

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

`--reload` restarts the server on every save. (FastAPI also ships `fastapi dev main.py`, a shortcut
that does the same thing with reload on by default — use whichever you like.)

```console
$ uvicorn main:app --reload
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     Started reloader process using WatchFiles
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

*What just happened:* Uvicorn bound to `127.0.0.1:8000` and is waiting for requests. Open
`http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in a browser, or hit it from the terminal:

```http
GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

```json
{
  "message": "The book API is alive"
}
```

*What just happened:* the request matched the `GET /` route, FastAPI called `read_root()`, and
serialized the returned dict to JSON. A working API in five lines of real code.

## The wow moment: docs you didn't write

Here's the feature that makes people switch frameworks. With the server still running, visit:

```http
GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

You'll see **Swagger UI** — a full, interactive documentation page listing every endpoint, with a
"Try it out" button that sends real requests to your running app. A second flavour lives at `/redoc`
(ReDoc) if you prefer a cleaner reading layout. Zero lines of documentation written to get either.

💡 **Both pages are generated from a single machine-readable document FastAPI builds automatically: the
OpenAPI schema** (served at `/openapi.json`). OpenAPI is the industry-standard way to describe an API
— what paths exist, what they accept, what they return. Tools across the ecosystem read it to
generate client libraries, run tests, or import the API into other software.

FastAPI produces all this from nothing because your type hints already told it everything it needed:
the paths come from your decorators, and (next phase) the parameters and response shapes come from the
types you annotate. **Your code already is the spec** — FastAPI just reads it.

## Type hints as the source of truth

This is the mental model that makes FastAPI *FastAPI*.

📝 **The core idea:** you annotate your function with Python types, and FastAPI uses those annotations
for four jobs at once — **parsing** incoming data into the right types, **validating** it (rejecting
bad input with a clear error), **documenting** it (in those auto-generated docs), and **serializing**
your return value back out. One declaration, kept honest in four places.

```mermaid

  T[Your type hints] --> V[Validation]
  T --> D[Auto docs / OpenAPI]
  T --> S[Serialization]
```

The payoff: these things can't drift apart. In a framework where you write validation by hand *and*
write docs by hand, the two slowly disagree — the docs say one thing, the code does another. With
FastAPI there's a single source, so validation rules, docs, and your editor's autocomplete all describe
the same truth.

You can feel this in pure Python, no framework involved — a function whose type hints describe exactly
what it takes and gives back:

```python runnable
def describe_book(title: str, year: int, price: float) -> str:
    return f"{title} ({year}) — ${price:.2f}"

# The hints document the function: title is text, year is a whole number, price is a decimal.
print(describe_book("Dune", 1965, 9.99))
print(describe_book.__annotations__)   # the hints are real data Python can read
```

```console
Dune (1965) — $9.99
{'title': <class 'str'>, 'year': <class 'int'>, 'price': <class 'float'>, 'return': <class 'str'>}
```

*What just happened:* the type hints (`title: str`, `year: int`, `price: float`) aren't decoration —
they're stored on the function in `__annotations__`, readable by any program. That's the lever FastAPI
pulls: it inspects those same annotations on your handlers and turns them into validation rules and
documentation automatically. Next phase you'll annotate a real `GET /books/{id}` handler and watch
FastAPI parse and check the `id` for you, purely from the hint.

## Where FastAPI fits

FastAPI isn't the only Python framework, and it isn't always the right one:

- **Flask** — minimal and sync-first. It hands you routing and not much else; you bring your own
  validation, serialization, and docs. Great for tiny apps and total control, more manual work as the
  API grows.
- **Django** — batteries included. A full stack with an ORM, admin panel, templating, auth — built for
  large database-backed websites. Powerful, but a lot of machine for a focused JSON API.
- **FastAPI** — purpose-built for **modern APIs**: async-capable, with validation and interactive docs
  baked in *because* of the type hints. The sweet spot when you're building an API (rather than a
  server-rendered website) and want correctness and documentation without hand-rolling them.

💡 If you're not sure what "REST API" means — what `GET`, `POST`, paths, and status codes are — read
[REST APIs explained](/guides/rest-apis-explained) alongside this guide; this guide leans on those terms
from the next phase on.

Next phase is where the type-hint magic becomes concrete: **path operations and parameters** — how
`GET /books/{id}?year=1965` maps to a function with typed arguments that FastAPI parses and validates
for you.

## Recap

1. **FastAPI** is a modern, async Python web framework for building APIs, built on **Starlette** (web)
   + **Pydantic** (validation), speaking **ASGI**.
2. **ASGI** is the async successor to WSGI: a server that can keep serving other requests while one
   waits on slow I/O — the foundation for FastAPI's `async def` handlers.
3. A first app is tiny: `app = FastAPI()`, a `@app.get("/")` function returning a dict, run with
   `uvicorn main:app --reload` (or `fastapi dev`).
4. The standout feature is **automatic interactive docs** — Swagger UI at `/docs`, ReDoc at `/redoc`,
   and an **OpenAPI** schema at `/openapi.json` — all generated from your code, no doc-writing.
5. **Type hints are the single source of truth:** FastAPI reads your annotations to parse, validate,
   document, and serialize — so those four things never drift apart.
6. FastAPI's niche is **modern APIs**: lighter than Django, less manual than Flask, with validation and
   docs built in.
