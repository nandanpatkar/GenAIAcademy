# Testing & Project Structure

The moment your Book API touches a real database and real auth, the temptation is to test it by spinning
up the server, opening `/docs`, and clicking around. That works exactly once, on your machine, on a good
day. It doesn't catch the bug you introduce next Tuesday, and it can't run in CI.

This phase is about two habits that travel together: testing FastAPI *properly* — fast, repeatable,
in-process, no clicking — and laying out the project so it stays testable as it grows. These aren't
separate topics: the reason FastAPI is so pleasant to test is the exact design we've been building
toward — everything is a dependency — and that same design keeps the codebase from collapsing into one
unreadable file.

## The mental model: your app is a callable, not a server

📝 The single idea that unlocks FastAPI testing: **your app object is just a Python object you can call
directly.** You don't need a running server, a port, or a real HTTP socket to test an endpoint. FastAPI's
`TestClient` takes your `app`, sends a request *into it in-process*, and hands you back the response — all
inside the same Python process as your test.

That's why it's fast (no network, no process startup) and reliable (no "is the server up yet?"
flakiness). A test is just: build a client, call a route, check what came back — the same
Arrange-Act-Assert shape you'd use for any function; see [Your First Unit
Test](/guides/your-first-unit-test) for that shape from scratch.

## `TestClient`: calling your app like a function

`TestClient` comes from Starlette (the toolkit under FastAPI) and its API is modeled on the popular
`requests` library, so `.get()`, `.post()`, `.json()`, and `.status_code` all read the way you'd expect.

A complete, real test of the Book API. It needs the app object, so it's plain code (you can't run a
server inside the browser sandbox):

```python
# tests/test_books.py
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from app.main import app           # your FastAPI() instance

client = TestClient(app)

def test_list_books_returns_200_and_a_list():
    # Act: send a GET into the app, in-process
    response = client.get("/books")

    # Assert: status code AND the shape of the body
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert isinstance(response.json(), list)

def test_create_book_returns_201_with_the_title():
    payload = {"title": "Dune", "author": "Frank Herbert"}
    response = client.post("/books", json=payload)

    assert response.status_code == 201
    body = response.json()
    assert body["title"] == "Dune"
    assert "id" in body          # the server assigned an id
```

*What just happened:* `TestClient(app)` wrapped your application so you can call it like an HTTP client
without any server running. `client.get("/books")` and `client.post("/books", json=...)` exercise the
*real* routing, the *real* Pydantic validation, the *real* response models — the whole stack from Phases
2–4 — and return a response object. You then assert on `status_code` and `response.json()`. We check more
than the status: a `201` with the wrong body is still a bug, so we assert the title round-trips and an
`id` was assigned. A genuine integration test, and it ran in milliseconds.

💡 Run these with `pytest` from your project root. It discovers any file named `test_*.py` and any
function named `test_*` inside it — no registration, no boilerplate:

```bash
pytest -q
```

A passing run looks like this:

```console
..                                                       [100%]
2 passed in 0.14s
```

## Dependency overrides: the testing superpower

Now the part that makes FastAPI testing genuinely special. [Phase 5](05-dependency-injection.md) promised
that because the database session, the current user, and everything else come in through `Depends()`,
your tests can *swap them out*. This is where you cash that promise.

📝 `app.dependency_overrides` is a dict that maps a dependency function to a replacement. When FastAPI is
about to call a dependency during a request, it checks this dict first — if there's an override, it calls
*that* instead. Your endpoint code doesn't change at all. It still asks for `get_session`; FastAPI just
quietly hands it the test double.

Two cases cover almost everything you'll ever need.

### Overriding the database with in-memory SQLite

You don't want tests hitting your real Postgres — slow, stateful, and one failing test can poison the
next. Point the session dependency at a fresh in-memory SQLite database that exists only for the test run:

```python
# tests/conftest.py
import pytest
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from sqlmodel import SQLModel, Session, create_engine
from sqlmodel.pool import StaticPool

from app.main import app
from app.db import get_session     # the real dependency from Phase 7

@pytest.fixture
def client():
    # one in-memory DB, shared across connections for this test
    engine = create_engine(
        "sqlite://",
        connect_args={"check_same_thread": False},
        poolclass=StaticPool,
    )
    SQLModel.metadata.create_all(engine)   # build the Book tables fresh

    def get_session_override():
        with Session(engine) as session:
            yield session

    # the swap: real session -> throwaway in-memory one
    app.dependency_overrides[get_session] = get_session_override

    yield TestClient(app)

    # teardown: undo the swap so the next test starts clean
    app.dependency_overrides.clear()
```

*What just happened:* The fixture stands up a brand-new SQLite database in memory, creates the Book
tables on it, and defines `get_session_override` — a `yield` dependency with the same shape as the real
one, but backed by the throwaway engine. The line `app.dependency_overrides[get_session] =
get_session_override` is the whole trick: every endpoint that does `Depends(get_session)` now gets the
test database, with zero changes to the endpoints. Each test that asks for the `client` fixture gets its
own pristine database, so tests can't contaminate each other.

⚠️ Look at that last line — `app.dependency_overrides.clear()`. **Overrides are global state on the app
object.** If you set one and don't reset it, it leaks into every test that runs afterward, and you get
the worst kind of bug: tests that pass or fail depending on what ran *before* them. Always undo overrides
in teardown; putting the override inside a fixture (which auto-runs its teardown after each test) is the
clean way to guarantee that.

### Overriding `get_current_user` to test protected routes

Protected endpoints from [Phase 8](08-authentication-and-security.md) are the other classic case. You
don't want to mint real JWTs in a test just to check `POST /books` works — you want to *pretend* you're
logged in:

```python
# tests/test_protected.py
from app.main import app
from app.dependencies import get_current_user

def fake_current_user():
    return {"username": "test-reader", "role": "admin"}

def test_create_book_when_authenticated(client):
    app.dependency_overrides[get_current_user] = fake_current_user
    try:
        response = client.post("/books", json={"title": "1984", "author": "Orwell"})
        assert response.status_code == 201
        assert response.json()["title"] == "1984"
    finally:
        app.dependency_overrides.pop(get_current_user, None)
```

*What just happened:* Instead of producing a valid token, you replaced the entire authentication
dependency with `fake_current_user`, which just returns a logged-in admin. The endpoint runs as if a real
user passed auth — no tokens, no password hashing, no headers to fake. The `try/finally` does the same job
as the fixture teardown above: it removes the override no matter what, so this test can't sabotage the
next one. This is how you test "what happens when an admin creates a book?" without dragging the whole
auth system into every test.

## The test pyramid, applied to this API

📝 Not every test should be an HTTP round-trip. The classic guidance — see
[Unit, Integration, E2E](/guides/unit-integration-e2e) — maps cleanly onto a FastAPI project:

- **Unit tests (the wide base).** Test pure functions and service logic *directly*, with no client and no
  app. If you have a `services.py` with `calculate_late_fee(book)` or `slugify_title(title)`, call it as a
  plain function and assert the result. Fastest and most numerous.
- **Integration tests (the middle).** Use `TestClient` to hit real endpoints against the in-memory test
  DB — what the examples above are. They prove routing, validation, the DB layer, and your response
  models all fit together. Most of your FastAPI tests live here.
- **End-to-end tests (the thin top).** A few tests against a *real* running server and a real (or
  containerized) database, exercising full flows like register → log in → create book → fetch it. Slow
  and more fragile, so keep them few and reserve them for critical paths.

💡 The honest rule of thumb: push logic down into plain functions you can unit-test, and use `TestClient`
for the seams where pieces meet. If you need an HTTP request just to test a calculation, that calculation
probably wants to be its own testable function.

## Project structure: escaping one giant `main.py`

⚠️ Every tutorial app starts as a single `main.py`, and that's fine — until it isn't. Once you have
books, authors, reviews, and auth, a 600-line `main.py` is where bugs hide and merge conflicts breed. You
can't find anything, and you can't test a slice of it in isolation.

📝 The fix is `APIRouter`. A router is a mini-FastAPI you can declare endpoints on, living in its own
module. You then *include* it into the main app — same routes, same behavior, just organized by feature.

A layout that scales without being over-engineered:

```text
app/
├── main.py            # creates FastAPI(), includes routers, app-wide config
├── db.py              # engine + get_session dependency (Phase 7)
├── models.py          # SQLModel Book, User, etc.
├── dependencies.py    # get_current_user and other shared dependencies
└── routers/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── books.py       # everything under /books
    └── auth.py        # everything under /auth
tests/
├── conftest.py        # the client fixture + overrides
├── test_books.py
└── test_protected.py
```

A router module and the include look like this:

```python
# app/routers/books.py
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, status
from sqlmodel import Session

from app.db import get_session
from app.models import Book

router = APIRouter(prefix="/books", tags=["books"])

@router.get("")
def list_books(session: Session = Depends(get_session)):
    return session.query(Book).all()

@router.post("", status_code=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)
def create_book(book: Book, session: Session = Depends(get_session)):
    session.add(book)
    session.commit()
    session.refresh(book)
    return book
```

```python
# app/main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
from app.routers import books, auth

app = FastAPI(title="Book API")

app.include_router(books.router)
app.include_router(auth.router)
```

*What just happened:* `APIRouter(prefix="/books", tags=["books"])` defines a self-contained set of routes;
the `prefix` means you write `@router.get("")` instead of repeating `/books` on every path, and the `tags`
group these endpoints together in `/docs`. In `main.py`, `app.include_router(books.router)` stitches the
router into the real application — at runtime the routes behave *identically* to having been declared on
`app` directly. The payoff: each feature lives in one file you can read, change, and test on its own, and
`main.py` shrinks to a short table of contents. (Remember from Phase 5 that `APIRouter` can also take
`dependencies=[...]` — that's how you require auth for every route in a router at once.)

## Settings, and the payoff

One last piece of structure. Hardcoding the database URL, secret key, or token expiry into your code is a
trap — different values in dev, test, and production, and secrets that must never be committed. The clean
answer is **pydantic-settings**: define a typed `Settings` model that reads from environment variables,
with the same validation you already trust from Pydantic.

```python
# app/config.py
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    database_url: str = "sqlite:///./books.db"
    secret_key: str
    access_token_expire_minutes: int = 30

    class Config:
        env_file = ".env"

settings = Settings()
```

*What just happened:* `Settings` pulls each field from an environment variable (or a `.env` file),
coerces and validates the types — `access_token_expire_minutes` *will* be an `int` or the app refuses to
start — and gives you one typed object to import. No more scattered `os.environ` lookups, no silently
wrong config. (You can even make `settings` a dependency and override it in tests, just like everything
else.)

💡 Step back and see the throughline of this whole guide. The reason all of this — swapping the test
database, faking the current user, splitting features into routers, overriding settings — is *easy* is
that nothing in your app reaches out and grabs its own dependencies. Everything is injected. Untestable
code is almost always un-injected code: a handler that constructs its own DB connection or reads
`os.environ` directly can't be tested without that real thing present. The layered, dependency-driven
design you've built isn't bureaucracy — it's exactly what makes the app testable, and exactly what makes
it ready for production. Which is where we go next.

## Recap

1. **`TestClient(app)`** calls your FastAPI app **in-process** — no server, no port, no network. It's
   built on Starlette with a `requests`-style API, so `client.get(...)`, `client.post(..., json=...)`,
   `.status_code`, and `.json()` are all you need. Run tests with `pytest`.
2. Assert on **more than the status code** — a `201` with the wrong body is still a bug. Check the shape
   and key fields of `response.json()`.
3. **`app.dependency_overrides`** swaps a real dependency for a test double: point `get_session` at an
   in-memory SQLite DB, or replace `get_current_user` to test protected routes without real auth. The
   endpoints don't change at all.
4. **Always reset overrides** (`.clear()` in a fixture teardown, or `try/finally`). They're global app
   state and leak between tests if you forget.
5. **Apply the test pyramid:** unit-test pure functions directly, use `TestClient` for endpoint
   (integration) tests, and keep a thin layer of real-DB end-to-end tests for critical flows.
6. **`APIRouter` + `app.include_router(...)`** splits one giant `main.py` into per-feature modules.
   **pydantic-settings** gives you typed config from the environment. Both exist because the whole design
   is dependency-driven — which is what makes the app testable in the first place.
