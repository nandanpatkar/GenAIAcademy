# Structuring & Testing

You've built the whole articles API in one file. That's the right way to start — one file you can read top to bottom beats a maze of folders you have to keep jumping between. But around the time you add a second resource, or your fourth handler reaches for the same store, the single-file version starts to creak. This phase is about the move that happens next, done in the way that won't bite you later.

The mental model to hold onto: **handlers stay thin, and their dependencies are explicit.** A handler's job is to read the request, call something that does the real work, and write a response. The "something" — your store, a logger, a config — should be handed to the handler on purpose, not reached for through a package-level global. The idiom Go reaches for here is a **struct that holds the dependencies, with methods that *are* your handlers**. Wire it once in `main`, and every handler gets what it needs through the receiver — no globals, no magic.

## Handlers as methods on a struct

Here's the shape. A `Handler` struct holds whatever the handlers need — for the articles API, that's the store. The handlers become methods on it.

```go
// handlers/handlers.go
package handlers

import (
    "encoding/json"
    "net/http"

    "github.com/go-chi/chi/v5"
    "yourmodule/store"
)

type Handler struct {
    Store *store.ArticleStore
}

func New(s *store.ArticleStore) *Handler {
    return &Handler{Store: s}
}

func (h *Handler) GetArticle(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    id := chi.URLParam(r, "id")
    a, ok := h.Store.Get(id)
    if !ok {
        http.Error(w, "not found", http.StatusNotFound)
        return
    }
    w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
    json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(a)
}
```

*What just happened:* `GetArticle` is a method on `*Handler`, but its signature is still exactly `func(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request)` — a plain `http.HandlerFunc`. The receiver `h` is how the handler reaches the store. There's no package-level `var store` anywhere; the dependency arrived through `h.Store`, set when we built the `Handler`. Dependency injection, minus the ceremony.

💡 Why a method instead of a free function that takes the store as an argument? Because `http.HandlerFunc` is fixed at `(w, r)` — you can't add a `store` parameter and still satisfy the interface. Hanging the handler off a struct gives it access to dependencies *without* changing its signature.

Now wire it in `main`:

```go
// main.go
package main

import (
    "log"
    "net/http"

    "github.com/go-chi/chi/v5"
    "github.com/go-chi/chi/v5/middleware"
    "yourmodule/handlers"
    "yourmodule/store"
)

func newRouter(s *store.ArticleStore) http.Handler {
    h := handlers.New(s)

    r := chi.NewRouter()
    r.Use(middleware.Logger)

    r.Route("/api/v1/articles", func(r chi.Router) {
        r.Get("/", h.ListArticles)
        r.Post("/", h.CreateArticle)
        r.Get("/{id}", h.GetArticle)
        r.Put("/{id}", h.UpdateArticle)
        r.Delete("/{id}", h.DeleteArticle)
    })
    return r
}

func main() {
    s := store.New()
    log.Println("listening on :8080")
    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", newRouter(s)))
}
```

*What just happened:* `main` does the wiring and nothing else — create the store, build the router, start the server. We pulled the router construction into its own `newRouter(s)` function that returns an `http.Handler`. That looks small, but it's the single most important move in this phase: because `newRouter` builds the *entire* application and hands you back an `http.Handler`, your tests can call it too and exercise the real thing.

📝 Notice `newRouter` returns `http.Handler`, not `*chi.Mux`. Callers (including `main` and your tests) only need the `http.Handler` behavior, so that's all you promise them. A chi router *is* an `http.Handler`, so this costs nothing.

## A layout that scales

You don't need a folder for everything on day one. But once you split, a conventional Go web layout looks like this:

```
articles-api/
  go.mod
  main.go            ← build the router, wire dependencies, start the server
  handlers/
    handlers.go      ← the Handler struct + its method handlers
  store/
    store.go         ← ArticleStore: Get/List/Create/Update/Delete
  models/
    article.go       ← the Article struct (shared shape)
```

The dependency arrows all point one way: `main` imports `handlers` and `store`; `handlers` imports `store` and `models`; `store` imports `models`; `models` imports nothing. Keep it acyclic and Go stays happy (it refuses to compile import cycles anyway, which is a feature).

⚠️ Don't over-split early. A `services/`, `repository/`, `dto/`, `interfaces/` tower of folders for a CRUD app with one resource is cosplay, not architecture. Start with the four above, and only add a layer when a real second use forces it — the layout should follow the code, not lead it.

## Request-scoped values through context, done right

Some data isn't part of the URL or the body — it belongs to *this request* and needs to travel from a middleware down to a handler. The authenticated user. A request ID for tracing. The standard library's answer is `context.Context`, which rides along on every `*http.Request`.

A middleware computes the value and stashes it; the handler reads it back out. Here's a request-ID example:

```go
// middleware/requestid.go
package mw

import (
    "context"
    "net/http"

    "github.com/google/uuid"
)

type ctxKey int

const requestIDKey ctxKey = 0

func RequestID(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
    return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        id := uuid.NewString()
        ctx := context.WithValue(r.Context(), requestIDKey, id)
        next.ServeHTTP(w, r.WithContext(ctx))
    })
}

// RequestIDFrom pulls the request ID back out, in a handler.
func RequestIDFrom(ctx context.Context) (string, bool) {
    id, ok := ctx.Value(requestIDKey).(string)
    return id, ok
}
```

*What just happened:* `context.WithValue` returns a *new* context carrying the value, and `r.WithContext(ctx)` returns a *new* request wrapping it — contexts and requests are immutable, so you always build a new one and pass it forward via `next.ServeHTTP`. Downstream handlers call `r.Context().Value(requestIDKey)` (wrapped here in the tidy `RequestIDFrom` helper) to read it back.

⚠️ The trap that bites everyone: **never use a bare string as the context key.** If you write `context.WithValue(ctx, "user", u)` and some library you import also writes `context.WithValue(ctx, "user", somethingElse)`, the keys collide and silently clobber each other — no compile error, just a baffling runtime bug. The fix is an **unexported custom key type**: `type ctxKey int` lives only in your package, so no other package can ever produce a value equal to your `requestIDKey`. That makes collisions impossible by construction.

Here's the handler side reading the value:

```go
func (h *Handler) GetArticle(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    if id, ok := mw.RequestIDFrom(r.Context()); ok {
        w.Header().Set("X-Request-ID", id)
    }
    // ... rest of the handler
}
```

*What just happened:* the handler never knew or cared *how* the request ID got there — it just asks the context. That's the payoff of the pattern: middleware and handler are decoupled, talking only through a typed, collision-proof key.

💡 Context carries more than your values. `r.Context()` also propagates **cancellation and deadlines**. If the client hangs up, or you wrap a route in `middleware.Timeout(2 * time.Second)`, the context's `Done()` channel fires — and any database driver or `http.Client` call that respects `context` will abort instead of running forever. Passing `r.Context()` down into your store and outbound calls is what makes that work: free request-scoped cancellation, as long as you thread the context through.

## Testing the whole router with httptest

Now collect on the promise from `newRouter`. Because it returns an `http.Handler`, and because the standard library ships `net/http/httptest`, you can test the *entire* stack — routing, middleware, and handler — without ever opening a real socket.

```go
// handlers/handlers_test.go
package handlers_test

import (
    "net/http"
    "net/http/httptest"
    "testing"
)

func TestGetArticle(t *testing.T) {
    r := newRouter(seedStore())   // your real router builder, seeded store
    req := httptest.NewRequest(http.MethodGet, "/api/v1/articles/1", nil)
    rec := httptest.NewRecorder()

    r.ServeHTTP(rec, req)

    if rec.Code != http.StatusOK {
        t.Fatalf("got %d", rec.Code)
    }
}
```

*What just happened:* `httptest.NewRequest` builds a `*http.Request` in memory, `httptest.NewRecorder` is a fake `http.ResponseWriter` that captures what the handler writes, and `r.ServeHTTP(rec, req)` runs the request through the real router exactly as a live server would. Afterward, `rec.Code`, `rec.Body`, and `rec.Header()` hold everything the handler produced. No port, no network, no flakiness.

⚠️ Here's the part people get wrong, and it's specific to routed frameworks like chi: **route through `r.ServeHTTP`, not by calling the handler directly.** It's tempting to write `h.GetArticle(rec, req)` and skip the router. Don't — `chi.URLParam(r, "id")` reads the `id` from chi's *route context*, which only gets attached when the request passes through the router that matched the pattern `/{id}`. Call the handler directly and that context is missing: `chi.URLParam` returns an empty string and your test exercises a code path that never happens in production. Test the router, not the bare function.

Testing a POST is the same shape, with a body and a header:

```go
import "strings"

func TestCreateArticle(t *testing.T) {
    r := newRouter(seedStore())
    body := `{"title":"Hello","body":"World"}`
    req := httptest.NewRequest(http.MethodPost, "/api/v1/articles", strings.NewReader(body))
    req.Header.Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
    rec := httptest.NewRecorder()

    r.ServeHTTP(rec, req)

    if rec.Code != http.StatusCreated {
        t.Fatalf("got %d, body: %s", rec.Code, rec.Body.String())
    }
}
```

*What just happened:* `strings.NewReader(body)` gives the request a JSON body to read, and `req.Header.Set("Content-Type", "application/json")` mirrors what a real client sends — if your handler checks the content type, the test now satisfies it. The router runs the full POST path: middleware, JSON decode, store write, `201 Created`. Including `rec.Body.String()` in the failure message means a broken test tells you *why* instead of just *what*.

💡 Step back and notice what you *didn't* have to learn. There's no chi-specific test harness, no special `TestClient`, no framework mock. Because your handlers are plain `net/http` handlers and your router is a plain `http.Handler`, your tests are plain `net/http` too — `httptest` is the standard library testing the standard library. That's the dividend chi pays for staying compatible: the skills transfer in both directions.

## Recap

- **Thin handlers, explicit dependencies:** a `Handler` struct holds the store; its methods *are* your `http.HandlerFunc`s, getting dependencies through the receiver instead of globals.
- **Wire once in `main`**, and pull router construction into a `newRouter(s) http.Handler` function so tests can build the real application too.
- **A small package layout** — `main.go`, `handlers/`, `store/`, `models/` — scales fine; don't add layers until a real second use demands them.
- **Context carries request-scoped values** set in middleware and read in handlers — always with an **unexported custom key type** (`type ctxKey int`), never a bare string, to make collisions impossible.
- **`r.Context()` also carries cancellation and deadlines**, so threading it down into stores and outbound calls gives you free timeout propagation.
- **Test through the real router** with `httptest`: `r.ServeHTTP(rec, req)` exercises routing + middleware + handler, and is the only way `chi.URLParam` resolves — calling the handler directly leaves chi's route context empty.
