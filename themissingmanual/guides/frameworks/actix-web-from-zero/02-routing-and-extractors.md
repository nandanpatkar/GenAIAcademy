# Routing & Extractors

Phase 1 stood up an `App`, an `HttpServer`, and one handler answering one path. This phase covers
how actix-web decides *which* handler runs for an incoming request, and how that handler gets the
request pieces it needs without ever touching the raw bytes.

Two mental models cover everything else.

> 📝 **Mental model #1 — a route is a tiny rule: `method + path → handler`.** When a request
> arrives, actix-web walks its list of registered rules looking for the first one whose HTTP
> method *and* path pattern match. `GET /articles` and `POST /articles` are two different routes
> even though the path is identical, because the method is part of the key.

> 📝 **Mental model #2 — a handler's parameters are extractors.** You don't reach into the request
> object. Instead you declare what you want as typed arguments — `web::Path<u32>`,
> `web::Query<Pagination>`, `web::Json<NewArticle>` — and actix-web *extracts* those values from
> the request before your function body ever runs. If extraction fails (bad path segment,
> malformed JSON), your handler isn't called at all; the framework returns an error response for
> you. Your function body only ever sees already-valid, already-typed data.

We'll keep growing the **articles API** from Phase 1 — same familiar shape:

```rust
struct Article {
    id: u32,
    title: String,
    body: String,
}
```

## Registering routes: two styles, same idea

actix-web gives you two ways to attach a handler to a route, producing identical behavior — the
difference is purely *where the route lives in your source*. You'll see both in the wild.

### Style 1: the builder

You spell out the route on the `App` itself with `.route(path, method().to(handler))`:

```rust
use actix_web::{web, App, HttpServer, HttpResponse, Responder};

async fn list() -> impl Responder {
    HttpResponse::Ok().body("all articles")
}

async fn show() -> impl Responder {
    HttpResponse::Ok().body("one article")
}

#[actix_web::main]
async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    HttpServer::new(|| {
        App::new()
            .route("/articles", web::get().to(list))
            .route("/articles/{id}", web::get().to(show))
    })
    .bind(("127.0.0.1", 8080))?
    .run()
    .await
}
```

*What just happened:* `web::get()` builds a route guard that only matches `GET` requests; `.to(list)`
says "when it matches, call `list`." Chaining two `.route(...)` calls gives the routing table two
rules. The `{id}` in the second path is a **placeholder** — it matches any single path segment
(`/articles/7`, `/articles/42`) and captures it for an extractor to read later. Routes are checked
top to bottom, and the first match wins.

### Style 2: attribute macros

The same routes, but the method and path move *up onto the handler* as an attribute, and you
register the handler with `.service(...)`:

```rust
use actix_web::{get, App, HttpServer, HttpResponse, Responder};

#[get("/articles")]
async fn list() -> impl Responder {
    HttpResponse::Ok().body("all articles")
}

#[get("/articles/{id}")]
async fn show() -> impl Responder {
    HttpResponse::Ok().body("one article")
}

#[actix_web::main]
async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    HttpServer::new(|| {
        App::new()
            .service(list)
            .service(show)
    })
    .bind(("127.0.0.1", 8080))?
    .run()
    .await
}
```

*What just happened:* `#[get("/articles")]` bundles the method + path *with* the function. The
function now *is* a service, registered with `.service(list)` instead of a `.route(...)` call.
There's a macro for each verb — `#[post(...)]`, `#[put(...)]`, `#[delete(...)]`, and so on.
Behaviorally this is the same routing table as Style 1; many codebases prefer it because each
handler carries its own route declaration right above it instead of a central list elsewhere.

> 💡 Pick one style and stay consistent within a project — a reader shouldn't have to check two
> places to learn where routes are defined. Macros read nicely for CRUD-style apps; the builder
> shines when composing routes programmatically.

## Grouping routes with `web::scope`

Real APIs version their endpoints and share common prefixes — `/api/v1/articles`,
`/api/v1/authors`, and so on. Typing `/api/v1/...` in front of every route is noisy and error-prone.
`web::scope` mounts a whole group of routes under a shared prefix:

```rust
use actix_web::{web, App, HttpServer, HttpResponse, Responder};

async fn list() -> impl Responder {
    HttpResponse::Ok().body("all articles")
}

async fn show() -> impl Responder {
    HttpResponse::Ok().body("one article")
}

#[actix_web::main]
async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    HttpServer::new(|| {
        App::new().service(
            web::scope("/api/v1")
                .route("/articles", web::get().to(list))
                .route("/articles/{id}", web::get().to(show)),
        )
    })
    .bind(("127.0.0.1", 8080))?
    .run()
    .await
}
```

*What just happened:* `web::scope("/api/v1")` creates a sub-router whose prefix is `/api/v1`. Every
route registered inside it is *relative* to that prefix, so `/articles` actually answers
`GET /api/v1/articles` and `/articles/{id}` answers `GET /api/v1/articles/7`. To cut a v2 of the
API, add a second scope and leave v1 untouched. Scopes can also carry their own state and
middleware (Phases 4 and 5).

## Extractors: turning a request into typed arguments

A handler's parameters are how it asks for pieces of the request. The three you'll reach for
constantly are `Path`, `Query`, and `Json`.

### `web::Path` — values from the URL

That `{id}` placeholder captures a path segment. `web::Path<T>` pulls it out and parses it into the
type you ask for:

```rust
use actix_web::{web, HttpResponse, Responder};

async fn show(path: web::Path<u32>) -> impl Responder {
    let id = path.into_inner();
    HttpResponse::Ok().body(format!("you asked for article {id}"))
}
```

*What just happened:* the handler declared `path: web::Path<u32>`. actix-web took the `{id}` segment
from the URL, parsed it as a `u32`, and only then called `show`. `path.into_inner()` unwraps the
`Path` wrapper to give you the plain `u32` inside. If the URL had been `/articles/banana`, the parse
would fail, `show` would never run, and the client would get a `400 Bad Request` automatically — zero
validation code needed for "is this segment actually a number."

When a route has several placeholders, ask for a tuple and destructure it:

```rust
use actix_web::{web, HttpResponse, Responder};

// route registered as "/authors/{name}/articles/{id}"
async fn show_by_author(path: web::Path<(String, u32)>) -> impl Responder {
    let (name, id) = path.into_inner();
    HttpResponse::Ok().body(format!("article {id} by {name}"))
}
```

*What just happened:* with two placeholders, `web::Path<(String, u32)>` captures both in order —
`{name}` becomes the `String`, `{id}` becomes the `u32`. `into_inner()` hands back the tuple to
destructure in one line. The tuple's *order* matches the order the placeholders appear in the path,
not their names, so keep them lined up.

### `web::Query` — values from the query string

Query parameters (`?page=2&per_page=20`) come in through `web::Query<T>`, where `T` is a struct that
derives serde's `Deserialize`:

```rust
use actix_web::{web, HttpResponse, Responder};
use serde::Deserialize;

#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct Pagination {
    page: u32,
    per_page: u32,
}

async fn list(q: web::Query<Pagination>) -> impl Responder {
    HttpResponse::Ok().body(format!("page {} of {} per page", q.page, q.per_page))
}
```

*What just happened:* `#[derive(Deserialize)]` on `Pagination` tells serde how to build it from
key/value pairs. `web::Query<Pagination>` reads the query string, matches each field by name, and
parses the values into the field types. A request to `/articles?page=2&per_page=20` gives you
`q.page == 2` and `q.per_page == 20`. As with `Path`, a missing or unparseable field means the
handler is never called and the client gets a `400`. (Add `serde` to `Cargo.toml` with
`features = ["derive"]`; we lean on it heavily from here on.)

### `web::Json` — the request body

For `POST`/`PUT` bodies sent as JSON, `web::Json<T>` deserializes the body into your type:

```rust
use actix_web::{web, HttpResponse, Responder};
use serde::Deserialize;

#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct NewArticle {
    title: String,
    body: String,
}

async fn create(body: web::Json<NewArticle>) -> impl Responder {
    let article = body.into_inner();
    HttpResponse::Ok().body(format!("creating '{}'", article.title))
}
```

*What just happened:* `web::Json<NewArticle>` read the raw request body, parsed it as JSON, and
deserialized it into a `NewArticle` before `create` ran. `body.into_inner()` (or field access like
`body.title`) gets at the data. A malformed body or missing required field produces a `400`
automatically — your handler only ever sees a fully-formed `NewArticle`.

## Combining extractors — and the one body rule

Extractors compose: a handler can ask for several at once, and actix-web fills them all in before
calling you. A create-under-an-author handler might want the author from the path *and* the article
from the body:

```rust
use actix_web::{web, HttpResponse, Responder};
use serde::Deserialize;

#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct NewArticle {
    title: String,
    body: String,
}

// route: "/authors/{name}/articles"
async fn create_for_author(
    path: web::Path<String>,
    body: web::Json<NewArticle>,
) -> impl Responder {
    let author = path.into_inner();
    let article = body.into_inner();
    HttpResponse::Ok().body(format!("'{}' by {author}", article.title))
}
```

*What just happened:* the handler declared two extractors as separate parameters. actix-web ran both
— pulled `{name}` from the URL into `path`, deserialized the JSON body into `body` — and only then
called `create_for_author`. List as many extractors as you need; they're just function parameters.

> ⚠️ One real constraint: **only one extractor may read the request body.** `web::Json` consumes
> the body stream, and a body can only be read once. A handler can have many `Path` and `Query`
> extractors but effectively **one** body extractor (`Json`, `Form`, or `Bytes`) — asking for two
> won't give you the data twice, it's a design error. More on `Json` in
> [Phase 3: Responders](03-responders.md).

## Recap

- A route is `method + path → handler`. `GET /articles` and `POST /articles` are distinct routes.
- Register routes two ways: the **builder** (`.route("/articles", web::get().to(list))`) or
  **attribute macros** (`#[get("/articles")]` + `.service(list)`) — same behavior, pick one and stay
  consistent.
- `web::scope("/api/v1")` mounts a group of routes under a shared prefix, for versioning an API.
- Extractors turn a request into typed arguments: `web::Path` (URL segments, `.into_inner()`),
  `web::Query` (query string into a `Deserialize` struct), `web::Json` (the request body).
- Failed extraction means your handler never runs — the client gets a `400` automatically.
- You can combine many extractors as parameters, but only **one** may read the body.
