# Responders

The whole chapter in one sentence: **a handler returns a value, and actix-web only accepts it if its type implements `Responder`.** You don't call that trait yourself — you return a type that implements it, and the framework does the conversion.

The question for every handler isn't "how do I write a response?" but "what type do I return?" Pick the right one for the job:

- Need full control over status, headers, and body? Return **`HttpResponse`** — the workhorse.
- Just shipping some JSON with a 200? Return **`web::Json<T>`** and let it serialize for you.
- Returning one consistent shape and want to stay terse? Return **`impl Responder`**.

> 📝 [Phase 2](02-routing-and-extractors.md) covered the *input* half of a handler — extractors pull `Path`, `Query`, and `Json` out of the request. This chapter is the *output* half. Input by extractor, output by `Responder`: that symmetry is the heart of how actix handlers are shaped.

Throughout we'll keep growing the **articles API**. Here's the model we're returning:

```rust
use serde::Serialize;

#[derive(Serialize)]
struct Article {
    id: u32,
    title: String,
    body: String,
}
```

*What just happened:* `#[derive(Serialize)]` from `serde` is the one prerequisite for sending a struct as JSON — without it, none of the `.json()` calls below would compile. Everything here assumes that derive is present.

## HttpResponse: the workhorse

`HttpResponse` is a builder. Start with a status from a named method (`Ok()`, `Created()`, `NotFound()`, and friends), then finish it one of three ways: `.json(&value)` to serialize a body as JSON, `.body("…")` for a raw body, or `.finish()` for no body at all.

```rust
use actix_web::{get, HttpResponse, Responder};

#[get("/articles/{id}")]
async fn get_article() -> impl Responder {
    let article = Article {
        id: 1,
        title: "Hello, actix".to_string(),
        body: "An article from our API.".to_string(),
    };

    HttpResponse::Ok().json(&article)
}
```

*What just happened:* `HttpResponse::Ok()` starts a `200 OK` response, and `.json(&article)` serializes the struct into the body and sets `Content-Type: application/json` for you. The return type is `impl Responder` because `HttpResponse` implements `Responder` — read it as "returns *something that can become a response*."

Returning a list is the same move — serde serializes a `Vec<Article>` into a JSON array:

```rust
use actix_web::{get, HttpResponse, Responder};

#[get("/articles")]
async fn list_articles() -> impl Responder {
    let articles = vec![
        Article { id: 1, title: "First".to_string(), body: "…".to_string() },
        Article { id: 2, title: "Second".to_string(), body: "…".to_string() },
    ];

    HttpResponse::Ok().json(&articles)
}
```

*What just happened:* `.json()` serializes *anything* that's `Serialize`, including a `Vec` — a list of articles becomes a JSON array with no extra ceremony.

`HttpResponse` earns "workhorse" status from its other status methods. Each is a different status code, pairing naturally with `.json()`, `.body()`, or `.finish()`:

```rust
use actix_web::HttpResponse;

// 201 Created — return the thing you just made.
HttpResponse::Created().json(&article);

// 204 No Content — success, nothing to send back (e.g. a DELETE).
HttpResponse::NoContent().finish();

// 404 Not Found — no body needed.
HttpResponse::NotFound().finish();

// 400 Bad Request — a plain-text explanation.
HttpResponse::BadRequest().body("id must be a positive integer");
```

*What just happened:* each builder picks a status; the finisher decides the body. Use `.json()` for a serializable value, `.body()` for plain text or raw bytes, `.finish()` when the status *is* the whole message. Named helpers cover the common codes; for anything exotic, `HttpResponse::build(StatusCode::IM_A_TEAPOT)` builds from a raw status.

> 💡 A useful instinct: the moment you want to control the status code, that's your cue to use `HttpResponse`. The other return types are conveniences that pin the status for you — great until you need to say `201` or `404`.

## web::Json: the shorthand

If your handler always returns a 200 with a JSON body, `HttpResponse::Ok().json(…)` is a touch verbose. `web::Json` is the shortcut: wrap your value in `web::Json(...)`, return it, and actix serializes it as a 200 automatically.

```rust
use actix_web::{get, web, Responder};

#[get("/articles/latest")]
async fn latest_article() -> impl Responder {
    let article = Article {
        id: 7,
        title: "Latest".to_string(),
        body: "The newest article.".to_string(),
    };

    web::Json(article)
}
```

*What just happened:* `web::Json(article)` is a responder that serializes its inner value and responds with `200 OK` — the same as `HttpResponse::Ok().json(&article)`, with less typing. You hand it the value by ownership, since the wrapper takes it over.

You met `web::Json` in [Phase 2](02-routing-and-extractors.md) as an *extractor* pulling a JSON body out of the request. Same type, both directions: input as a parameter, output as a return value.

> ⚠️ The tradeoff is real: `web::Json` *always* responds with 200. Need a `201 Created` after a POST, or a `404` when the article doesn't exist? `web::Json` can't express it — go back to `HttpResponse::Ok().json(...)` / `HttpResponse::Created().json(...)` to choose the status. Reach for `web::Json` on read paths where 200 is genuinely always correct; use `HttpResponse` everywhere the status varies.

## The trap: different branches, different types

This one bites everyone exactly once. Write a handler that returns 200 when it finds the article and 404 when it doesn't, and the compiler refuses to build it:

```rust
use actix_web::{get, web, HttpResponse, Responder};

// ⚠️ This does NOT compile.
#[get("/articles/{id}")]
async fn get_article(path: web::Path<u32>) -> impl Responder {
    let id = path.into_inner();

    if id == 0 {
        HttpResponse::NotFound().finish()   // one type…
    } else {
        web::Json(Article {                 // …a DIFFERENT type
            id,
            title: "Found".to_string(),
            body: "…".to_string(),
        })
    }
}
```

*What just happened:* the two branches return *different concrete types* — one `HttpResponse`, the other `web::Json<Article>`. `impl Responder` means "some single type that implements `Responder`," and a function can only return one concrete type, even if both implement it. The compiler error, "expected `HttpResponse`, found `Json<Article>`," is its way of saying "pick one type."

The fix: make every branch produce the *same* concrete type. Easiest choice is `HttpResponse` for both, since it can represent any status:

```rust
use actix_web::{get, web, HttpResponse, Responder};

#[get("/articles/{id}")]
async fn get_article(path: web::Path<u32>) -> impl Responder {
    let id = path.into_inner();

    if id == 0 {
        HttpResponse::NotFound().finish()
    } else {
        HttpResponse::Ok().json(&Article {
            id,
            title: "Found".to_string(),
            body: "…".to_string(),
        })
    }
}
```

*What just happened:* both branches now return `HttpResponse`, so the function has one consistent return type and the compiler is happy. Status and body differ, but the type is identical, and that's all Rust cares about.

> 💡 Rule of thumb: **the moment a handler can return more than one status, return `HttpResponse` from every branch.** Save `web::Json` and bare `impl Responder` for handlers with exactly one outcome shape. (A cleaner way to vary status exists — returning a `Result` and letting `ResponseError` map errors to status codes, covered in [Phase 6](06-rest-api-and-errors.md). For now, one `HttpResponse` type in branchy handlers is the working answer.)

## impl Responder vs HttpResponse: which to write

`impl Responder` in the return position means "I'm returning *some* type that implements `Responder`, and I'd rather not spell out which." It's ergonomic when there's a single, obvious response shape — a handler that always returns a `web::Json<Article>`, or always an `HttpResponse`.

`HttpResponse` is the explicit, flexible choice: write it when you need control over the status, when branches must agree on a type (the trap above), or when the signature should state plainly "this returns an HTTP response."

```rust
use actix_web::{get, web, HttpResponse, Responder};

// Single shape, terse: impl Responder is a fine fit.
#[get("/ping")]
async fn ping() -> impl Responder {
    web::Json(serde_json::json!({ "status": "ok" }))
}

// Status varies / branches: be explicit with HttpResponse.
#[get("/articles/{id}/exists")]
async fn exists(path: web::Path<u32>) -> HttpResponse {
    if path.into_inner() == 0 {
        HttpResponse::NotFound().finish()
    } else {
        HttpResponse::Ok().finish()
    }
}
```

*What just happened:* the first handler has one outcome, so `impl Responder` keeps it clean. The second can return two statuses, so it names `HttpResponse` outright, and both branches line up with no fuss. The difference is flexibility (name `HttpResponse`) versus brevity (`impl Responder` for a single shape).

> 📝 Strings work too: a `&'static str` or `String` sends a `200 OK` text body — handy for a health check, rarely what you want for a real API. The articles API speaks JSON, so `HttpResponse` and `web::Json` are your day-to-day tools.

## Recap

- A handler's return type must implement **`Responder`**; the framework calls into that trait to turn your value into an HTTP response.
- **`HttpResponse`** is the workhorse: a builder with status helpers (`Ok`, `Created`, `NotFound`, `NoContent`, `BadRequest`) finished by `.json(&value)`, `.body("…")`, or `.finish()`.
- **`web::Json(value)`** is the shorthand for "200 + JSON body" — terse, but locked to status 200. Same wrapper, extractor on input, responder on output.
- **Different branches must return the same concrete type.** Mixing `HttpResponse` and `web::Json` across `if` branches won't compile; use one `HttpResponse` type everywhere a handler can vary status (or use [Phase 6](06-rest-api-and-errors.md)'s `Result` / `ResponseError`).
- Choose **`impl Responder`** for single-shape, terse handlers; **`HttpResponse`** for control and branchy handlers.
