# Spring AOP & Proxies

This is the phase where the rest of Spring stops being magic. You've used `@Transactional` in
[Spring Boot From Zero](/guides/spring-boot-from-zero) and trusted it to wrap your method in a transaction,
and maybe sprinkled `@Async` on something and watched it run on another thread. They felt like spells —
annotate a method and behavior appears from nowhere. By the end of this phase you'll know exactly where
that behavior comes from, why it sometimes *doesn't* appear, and why one specific way of calling your own
method silently breaks it.

**Spring never edits your class. When a bean needs extra behavior, Spring hands out a wrapper instead of
the real object — and the wrapper does the extra work before delegating to you.** That wrapper is called a
*proxy*. Once you can see the proxy in the call path, every "why didn't my annotation fire?" answers itself.

We'll keep our cast from [Phase 4](04-dependency-injection-deep.md): a `NotificationService` that sends
messages through a `MessageSender`. This time the interesting part isn't *what* it does — it's the
cross-cutting behavior we want to bolt on without touching its code.

## Cross-cutting concerns

📝 Some behavior doesn't belong to any one method — it cuts *across* many of them. Logging every call.
Timing how long methods take. Starting a database transaction. Checking the user is allowed in. None of that
is the *business logic* of `NotificationService`, yet all of it wants to happen *around* its methods (and
around the methods of a dozen other services too).

The naive approach is to paste it into every method:

```java
public void notify(String to, String message) {
    long start = System.currentTimeMillis();      // timing noise
    System.out.println("ENTER notify");           // logging noise
    try {
        sender.send(to, message);                 // ← the one line that matters
    } finally {
        System.out.println("EXIT notify (" + (System.currentTimeMillis() - start) + "ms)");
    }
}
```

*What just happened:* one line of actual work is buried under four lines of plumbing. Now imagine that same
plumbing copy-pasted into every method of every service. It's noise, it drifts out of sync, and changing the
log format means editing a hundred methods. This repeated, scattered, non-business behavior is what we call a
**cross-cutting concern**.

📝 **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)** is the answer: define that cross-cutting behavior *once*, in one
place, and declare *where* it should apply — instead of pasting it everywhere. Three words you'll need:

- **Aspect** — the module that holds the cross-cutting behavior (the timing/logging code, living in one class).
- **Advice** — the actual code that runs, and *when* it runs (before the method, after it, or around it).
- **Pointcut** — the expression that says *which* methods the advice applies to ("every method in the service package").

## A simple aspect

Here's the timing-and-logging plumbing pulled out of `notify` and turned into an aspect that applies to the
*entire* service package — no edit to `NotificationService` at all.

```java
import org.aspectj.lang.ProceedingJoinPoint;
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Around;
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Aspect
@Component
public class TimingAspect {

    // Pointcut: "any method in any class under com.example.service"
    @Around("execution(* com.example.service..*(..))")
    public Object timeIt(ProceedingJoinPoint pjp) throws Throwable {
        String name = pjp.getSignature().toShortString();
        System.out.println("ENTER " + name);
        long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
        try {
            return pjp.proceed();                 // ← run the real method
        } finally {
            long ms = System.currentTimeMillis() - start;
            System.out.println("EXIT  " + name + " (" + ms + "ms)");
        }
    }
}
```

*What just happened:* `@Aspect` marks this class as a holder of advice; `@Component` makes it a bean so
Spring finds it (you'd also enable AOP with `@EnableAspectJAutoProxy` on a `@Configuration` class — Boot does
this for you). The `@Around` advice wraps the *target* method: its `execution(...)` string is the
**pointcut** picking every method under the service package, and `pjp.proceed()` is the moment the real
method actually runs. Everything before `proceed()` happens on the way in; everything in the `finally`
happens on the way out. `NotificationService` knows nothing about any of this.

Call `notificationService.notify("a@b.com", "hi")` and you'd see:

```console
ENTER NotificationService.notify(..)
EMAIL -> a@b.com: hi
EXIT  NotificationService.notify(..) (3ms)
```

*What just happened:* the `EMAIL ->` line is your real method running inside `proceed()`. The `ENTER`/`EXIT`
lines came from the aspect, sandwiched around it — yet `NotificationService.notify` still contains only the
single line that matters. That's AOP's payoff: the concern lives in one class and applies everywhere the
pointcut matches. This is the *readable face* of AOP. Now the question that actually matters: how does code
in one class run "around" a method in a completely different class that never mentions it?

## How it actually works: proxies

Here's the reveal the whole phase is built on. 📝 **Spring does not rewrite `NotificationService`. It does
not inject the aspect into it. Instead, when a bean's methods are matched by some advice, Spring replaces the
bean it hands out with a *proxy* — a generated object that wraps your real bean, intercepts every incoming
call, runs the advice, and then delegates to the real method.**

Remember `BeanPostProcessor` from [Phase 5](05-bean-scopes-and-lifecycle.md)? This is its biggest payoff. A
`BeanPostProcessor` gets a chance to inspect and *replace* each bean after it's created but before it's
handed out. Spring's AOP infrastructure registers exactly such a processor: it sees that
`NotificationService` matches an aspect's pointcut, and in the post-processing step it swaps your raw bean
for a proxy that wraps it. So everywhere `NotificationService` gets injected — into a controller, another
service, a test — what actually lands in that slot is **the proxy**, not your object.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Caller[Some caller] -->|notify&#40;&#41;| Proxy[NotificationService proxy]
  Proxy -->|run advice ENTER + timer| Proxy
  Proxy -->|proceed&#40;&#41;| Real[real NotificationService]
  Real -->|return| Proxy
  Proxy -->|run advice EXIT| Caller
```

*What just happened:* the caller thinks it's holding a `NotificationService` and calls `notify()` normally.
The call actually lands on the **proxy**, which runs the advice (log + start timer), calls `proceed()` to
reach your real method, gets the result back, runs the rest of the advice (stop timer + log), and returns.
Your real object never knew it was wrapped. The interception only works because the proxy *is* the thing
everyone holds a reference to.

📝 Spring builds that proxy one of two ways, and which one matters later:

- **JDK dynamic proxy** — used when your bean implements an **interface**. Java's built-in
  `java.lang.reflect.Proxy` creates a new class implementing the *same interface*, forwarding each method to
  the advice and then your bean. The proxy is a sibling implementation of the interface, *not* a subclass of
  your class.
- **CGLIB proxy** — used when there's **no interface** (or Spring is configured to always use it, which Boot
  defaults to). CGLIB generates a runtime **subclass** of your concrete class and overrides each method to
  insert the advice. Because it works by subclassing and overriding, a `final` class or `final` method
  *can't* be proxied this way — there's nothing to override.

💡 The practical takeaway: if you program to interfaces, you might get a JDK proxy that is *not* an instance
of your concrete class (so `(EmailSenderImpl) bean` would fail — cast to the interface instead). With CGLIB
you get a subclass, so concrete-type casts work but `final` blocks proxying. Either way, the object other
beans hold is a stand-in, not your original.

## This is how @Transactional, @Async, and @Cacheable work

💡 Here's the payoff that makes all of Boot's "magic" annotations click at once. **They are all just
advice running in a proxy.** There is nothing else to them.

- **`@Transactional`** — Spring's transaction infrastructure registers advice whose pointcut is "any method
  annotated `@Transactional`." The proxy's advice opens a transaction *before* calling `proceed()`, then
  **commits** if your method returns normally or **rolls back** if it throws. Your method body just does its
  work; the begin/commit/rollback lives entirely in the proxy wrapped around it.
- **`@Async`** — the advice doesn't call `proceed()` on the caller's thread at all. It hands the real method
  off to a thread pool and returns immediately (a `Future`, or nothing). The "it runs on another thread"
  behavior is the proxy choosing *where* to invoke your method.
- **`@Cacheable`** — before calling `proceed()`, the advice checks a cache for the method's arguments. Hit?
  It returns the cached value and never touches your method. Miss? It calls `proceed()` and stores the
  result on the way out.

```java
@Service
public class NotificationService {

    @Transactional                 // advice: begin tx → proceed() → commit / rollback
    public void notifyAndLog(String to, String message) {
        sender.send(to, message);
        auditRepo.save(new AuditRecord(to));   // both writes in one transaction
    }
}
```

*What just happened:* there is no transaction code in this method — and yet both writes commit together or
roll back together. The `@Transactional` proxy is doing it: open a transaction, `proceed()` into your body,
commit on clean return. You're seeing the exact mechanism behind the [service-layer transactions in Spring
Boot](/guides/spring-boot-from-zero). The annotation was never a spell — it was a marker telling Spring's
proxy where to wrap.

## The self-invocation gotcha, explained at the root

Now the famous bug — the one that bites every Spring developer at least once, the one flagged back in the
[Spring Boot service-layer phase](/guides/spring-boot-from-zero). You now have everything you need to
understand *why* it happens, not just that it does.

⚠️ **Calling a `@Transactional` (or `@Async`, or `@Cacheable`) method from another method in the *same
class* does nothing.** No transaction. No new thread. No cache. Silently.

```java
@Service
public class NotificationService {

    public void notifyAll(List<String> recipients) {
        for (String to : recipients) {
            sendOne(to);                 // ⚠️ internal call — bypasses the proxy
        }
    }

    @Transactional
    public void sendOne(String to) {     // expected to run in its own transaction...
        sender.send(to, "hi");
        auditRepo.save(new AuditRecord(to));
    }
}
```

*What just happened:* you'd expect each `sendOne` to run in its own transaction. It doesn't — every call runs
with **no transaction at all**. Here's the root cause, now that you can see the proxy. The advice lives on
the proxy, *not* on your real object. When some outside caller invokes `notifyAll`, that call goes through
the proxy fine. But inside `notifyAll`, the call `sendOne(to)` is really `this.sendOne(to)` — and `this` is
your **real object**, not the proxy. The call goes straight from one method to another inside the same
object; it never leaves through the proxy, so the `@Transactional` advice never gets a chance to run.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Caller -->|notifyAll&#40;&#41;| Proxy[proxy]
  Proxy -->|proceed| Real[real bean]
  Real -->|this.sendOne&#40;&#41; — stays inside| Real
```

*What just happened:* the entry to `notifyAll` passes through the proxy, but the inner `this.sendOne()` is an
internal jump that the proxy never sees. No proxy in the path means no advice — and `@Transactional` *is*
advice. This is the whole gotcha in one sentence: **advice only fires when the call crosses the proxy
boundary, and `this.method()` never crosses it.**

The fixes all share one idea — make the call go *through* the proxy:

**Fix 1 — split into another bean.** Move the annotated method to a separate bean and inject it. Now the call
crosses a real bean boundary, which means it goes through *that* bean's proxy.

```java
@Service
public class NotificationService {
    private final SingleSender singleSender;   // injected: this is the PROXY of SingleSender

    public NotificationService(SingleSender singleSender) {
        this.singleSender = singleSender;
    }

    public void notifyAll(List<String> recipients) {
        for (String to : recipients) {
            singleSender.sendOne(to);          // ✅ goes through SingleSender's proxy
        }
    }
}

@Service
public class SingleSender {
    @Transactional
    public void sendOne(String to) { /* ... */ }
}
```

*What just happened:* `singleSender` is injected, so it's the *proxy* of `SingleSender`. Calling
`singleSender.sendOne(to)` is an external call that crosses the proxy boundary, so the `@Transactional`
advice fires and each call gets its own transaction. This is usually the cleanest fix — and it often reveals
a sensible separation of responsibilities you were missing anyway.

**Fix 2 — self-inject the proxy.** If you really want the method to stay in the same class, inject the bean
into *itself* and call through that reference instead of `this`.

```java
@Service
public class NotificationService {
    private final NotificationService self;    // the PROXY of this very bean

    public NotificationService(@Lazy NotificationService self) {
        this.self = self;
    }

    public void notifyAll(List<String> recipients) {
        for (String to : recipients) {
            self.sendOne(to);                  // ✅ through the proxy, not this
        }
    }

    @Transactional
    public void sendOne(String to) { /* ... */ }
}
```

*What just happened:* `self` is the proxy-wrapped version of this same bean (`@Lazy` breaks the chicken-and-egg
of injecting a bean into its own constructor). Calling `self.sendOne(to)` routes through the proxy, so the
advice runs. It works, but it's a bit of a head-scratcher to read — most teams prefer Fix 1.

💡 Every "why didn't my annotation fire?" in Spring has the same shape: *was there a proxy in the call
path?* Private methods can't be advised (the proxy can't override them). Internal `this.` calls skip
advice. A `new SomeService()` you constructed yourself has no proxy at all. Once you picture the proxy
standing between caller and bean, the whole category of mysteries collapses into one question.

## Recap

1. **Cross-cutting concerns** — logging, timing, transactions, security — repeat across many methods and
   aren't business logic. AOP lets you define them once and declare *where* they apply, instead of pasting
   them everywhere.
2. **Aspect / advice / pointcut.** An *aspect* holds the behavior, *advice* is the code that runs and when
   (`@Around` wraps the method via `proceed()`), and a *pointcut* (`execution(...)`) selects which methods it
   applies to.
3. **Proxies are the mechanism.** Spring never edits your class. A `BeanPostProcessor` swaps your bean for a
   *proxy* that intercepts calls, runs the advice, then delegates to your real method. The object injected
   everywhere is the proxy.
4. **JDK dynamic proxy vs CGLIB.** JDK proxies wrap a bean that implements an *interface* (sibling
   implementation); CGLIB *subclasses* a concrete class (so `final` classes/methods can't be proxied). Boot
   defaults to CGLIB.
5. **`@Transactional`, `@Async`, `@Cacheable` are all just advice in a proxy.** The proxy begins/commits a
   transaction, dispatches to a thread pool, or checks a cache *around* your untouched method body. That's
   the whole "magic."
6. **Self-invocation skips it.** ⚠️ Advice fires only when a call crosses the proxy boundary. `this.method()`
   stays inside the real object and never reaches the proxy, so the annotation silently does nothing. Fix by
   splitting into another bean, or self-injecting the proxy.
