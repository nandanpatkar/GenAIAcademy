summary: "Learn the cloud-native Java framework built for fast startup and low memory: why Quarkus moves work to build time, its loved dev mode, REST APIs, build-time CDI, Hibernate with Panache, configuration, reactive programming with Mutiny, testing, and compiling to a native executable. The standards you know, made supersonic."

# Quarkus From Zero

Quarkus calls itself "supersonic subatomic Java," which sounds like marketing until you watch a Quarkus
app boot in tens of milliseconds and sip a fraction of the memory a traditional Java service needs. It
was built for a world that didn't exist when classic Java frameworks were designed: containers,
Kubernetes, serverless, and autoscaling — where slow startup and fat memory cost real money. If you've
done [Spring Boot](/guides/spring-boot-from-zero) or [Jakarta EE](/guides/jakarta-ee-from-zero), Quarkus
will feel familiar *and* faster — because it runs the same standards (CDI, JAX-RS, Hibernate,
MicroProfile) but optimizes them in a fundamentally different way.

The one idea that explains everything Quarkus does: **move work from runtime to build time.** Classic
frameworks scan, reflect, and wire everything when the app *starts*; Quarkus does as much of that as
possible when the app is *compiled*, so startup is nearly free — and so the app can even be compiled to a
native machine-code executable. We build that mental model first, then walk the pieces you'll actually
use, demystifying each.

> 📝 This assumes you know **Java** and will lean on concepts from [Jakarta EE](/guides/jakarta-ee-from-zero)
> (CDI, JAX-RS) and [Hibernate & JPA](/guides/hibernate-and-jpa-from-zero) (Panache simplifies these). If
> those are new, do them first — Quarkus is "the standards, optimized," so knowing the standards pays off.

## How to read this

Read in order — it builds one example (a small `Product` service) and adds a capability each phase. The
real magic to *feel* is dev mode (Phase 2) and native compilation (Phase 9). Phases carry difficulty badges.

## The phases

**Part 1 — The Quarkus way (🟢 Basic)**
1. **[What Quarkus Is & Why It's Fast](01-what-quarkus-is.md)** 🟢 — build-time vs runtime work, native images, and how it relates to Spring Boot / Jakarta EE.
2. **[Dev Mode & the Developer Experience](02-dev-mode-and-dx.md)** 🟢 — live reload, the Dev UI, continuous testing — the thing people fall in love with.
3. **[Building REST APIs](03-rest-apis.md)** 🟢 — JAX-RS endpoints (RESTEasy Reactive) and JSON, the standards you already know.

**Part 2 — A real application (🟡 Intermediate)**
4. **[CDI in Quarkus (ArC)](04-cdi-with-arc.md)** 🟡 — build-time dependency injection: the same `@Inject`, wired at compile time.
5. **[Persistence: Hibernate with Panache](05-persistence-with-panache.md)** 🟡 — Panache's active-record and repository patterns over Hibernate.
6. **[Configuration](06-configuration.md)** 🟡 — MicroProfile Config, `application.properties`, profiles, and injecting config.

**Part 3 — Going further (🔴 Advanced → 🟢)**
7. **[Reactive Quarkus with Mutiny](07-reactive-with-mutiny.md)** 🔴 — `Uni`/`Multi`, reactive vs imperative, and when each fits.
8. **[Testing Quarkus Apps](08-testing.md)** 🟡 — `@QuarkusTest`, continuous testing, and testing the native build.
9. **[Native Compilation & Containers](09-native-compilation.md)** 🔴 — GraalVM native images, the closed-world model, and container-first deployment.
10. **[Production & Where to Go Next](10-where-to-go-next.md)** 🟢 — health/metrics, Kubernetes-native, the extension ecosystem, and what to build.

> Quarkus isn't a rejection of Spring/Jakarta EE — it's the same ideas re-engineered for the container
> era. Knowing the standards (this guide assumes them) is exactly what makes Quarkus click.
