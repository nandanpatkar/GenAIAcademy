# Celery From Zero

Some work is too slow to do during a web request: sending an email, generating a report, processing an
upload, calling a slow third-party API. Make the user wait for it and your app feels broken. Celery is the
answer the Python world reaches for — a **distributed task queue** that lets your app hand a job off to
run *later*, on a separate pool of worker processes, while the request returns instantly. FastAPI,
Django, and Flask apps all lean on it for exactly this.

The mental model that makes Celery click is a four-part hand-off: your app puts a **task** message on a
**broker** (a queue, usually Redis or RabbitMQ); one of several **workers** picks it up and runs it; and
an optional **result backend** stores what it returned. Once you see those four pieces — and that they're
separate processes talking through a queue — Celery stops being intimidating configuration and becomes a
shape you can reason about (and debug).

> 📝 This assumes **Python** ([Python From Zero](/guides/python-from-zero)) and pairs naturally with the
> queue concepts in [Webhooks & Message Queues](/guides/webhooks-and-message-queues). It's the background
> worker that the framework guides ([FastAPI](/guides/fastapi-from-zero), [Django](/guides/django-from-zero),
> [Flask](/guides/flask-from-zero)) all hand heavy jobs to. Celery needs a broker + worker processes, so
> examples are shown with the commands to run them yourself.

## How to read this

Read in order — it builds from a single background task up to scheduled jobs and a monitored production
setup, using a running example of a web app offloading email and report work. Phases carry difficulty
badges.

## The phases

**Part 1 — The core model (🟢 Basic → 🟡)**
1. **[What Celery Is & Why](01-what-celery-is.md)** 🟢 — the problem, and the broker/worker/result mental model.
2. **[The Broker & Worker](02-the-broker-and-worker.md)** 🟢 — the queue (Redis/RabbitMQ) and the worker processes that drain it.
3. **[Defining & Calling Tasks](03-defining-and-calling-tasks.md)** 🟡 — `@task`, `.delay()`/`.apply_async()`, and how a job gets queued and run.

**Part 2 — Doing it right (🟡 → 🔴)**
4. **[Results & State](04-results-and-state.md)** 🟡 — the result backend, `AsyncResult`, and tracking task status.
5. **[Retries & Error Handling](05-retries-and-error-handling.md)** 🔴 — retrying failures, idempotency, and not losing work.
6. **[Scheduled Tasks with Celery Beat](06-scheduled-tasks-celery-beat.md)** 🟡 — periodic, cron-like jobs.

**Part 3 — Production (🔴 → 🟢)**
7. **[Production: Scaling, Monitoring & Pitfalls](07-production-scaling-monitoring.md)** 🔴 — concurrency, Flower, and the mistakes that bite everyone.
8. **[Where to Go Next](08-where-to-go-next.md)** 🟢 — Celery vs the alternatives, framework integration, and what to build.

> The whole thing is a hand-off: app → broker → worker → (result). Hold those four pieces and Celery's
> configuration and quirks all fall into place.
