# Routing & Minimal APIs

Here's the whole mental model: **a route is an HTTP method plus a path, pointing at a handler.** `GET /products` is one route; `POST /products` is a different one — same path, different method, different code runs. ASP.NET Core keeps a table of these, and when a request arrives it looks up the method-and-path pair and runs the matching handler.

Minimal APIs are the leanest way to fill that table. `app.MapGet`, `app.MapPost`, and friends each register "when *this* method hits *this* path, run *this* function," usually a small lambda. The clever part: the framework looks at your handler's parameters and **fills them in for you** from the route, the query string, or the request body.

> 📝 You'll keep growing the **products API** from Phase 1. By the end of this phase it'll answer to a list endpoint and a by-id endpoint, return proper status codes, and live under a versioned URL prefix.

## The method maps

Every HTTP method you care about has a matching `Map` call on `app`:

```csharp
app.MapGet("/products", () => "all products");
app.MapPost("/products", () => "create a product");
app.MapPut("/products/{id}", (int id) => $"replace product {id}");
app.MapPatch("/products/{id}", (int id) => $"patch product {id}");
app.MapDelete("/products/{id}", (int id) => $"delete product {id}");
```

*What just happened:* five routes, registered in five lines. `/products` appears twice — `MapGet` and `MapPost` are two separate routes because the method is part of the identity. The string is the path; the lambda is the handler.

Let's make the products list real instead of returning a string, by seeding a tiny in-memory list:

```csharp
var products = new List<Product>
{
    new(1, "Keyboard", 79.99m),
    new(2, "Mouse", 29.99m),
    new(3, "Monitor", 249.00m),
};

app.MapGet("/products", () => products);

app.Run();

record Product(int Id, string Name, decimal Price);
```

*What just happened:* The handler returns a `List<Product>`. When you return an object (or a list of them) from a minimal API handler, ASP.NET Core **serializes it to JSON automatically** and sends it back with `Content-Type: application/json`. Return a `string` and you get plain text instead — no serialization code required.

Run it and hit the endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/products
```

You'll get back a JSON array of the three products. So far, so good — but a real API needs to fetch *one* product, and that's where parameters come in.

## Route parameters

A path can contain a **placeholder** in curly braces. Write `{id}` in the route and an `int id` in the handler's parameter list, and ASP.NET Core matches them by name and converts the URL text into the type you asked for:

```csharp
app.MapGet("/products/{id}", (int id) =>
{
    var product = products.FirstOrDefault(p => p.Id == id);
    return product;
});
```

*What just happened:* a request to `/products/2` makes ASP.NET Core pull `"2"` out of the URL, see your parameter is an `int`, parse it, and pass `2` into your lambda as `id`. The match is **by name** — `{id}` binds to the parameter named `id`, not by position.

That automatic conversion has a useful side effect: `/products/banana` can't become an `int`, so the route doesn't match and the framework returns a 400 — your handler never runs with bad data. Make that intent explicit with a **route constraint**, written as `{name:type}`:

```csharp
app.MapGet("/products/{id:int}", (int id) => products.FirstOrDefault(p => p.Id == id));
app.MapGet("/products/category/{slug:alpha}", (string slug) => $"category: {slug}");
```

*What just happened:* `{id:int}` tells the router "only match this route if the segment is an integer." `{slug:alpha}` matches only letters. Constraints filter *whether the route matches at all* — handy when two routes would otherwise collide, like a numeric id versus a text slug in the same position.

> ⚠️ Don't lean on route constraints for *validation*. They decide routing, not correctness — `{id:int}` happily accepts `-999` or `0`. Constraints answer "does this URL belong to this endpoint?" Real input checking is its own job — the whole of Phase 3.

## Query parameters

Route parameters live *in the path*. **Query parameters** live after the `?` — `/products?page=2&q=mouse` — the natural home for optional things like paging, filtering, and search. The binding rule is consistent: any handler parameter that **isn't** named in the route gets pulled from the query string (for simple types like `int`, `string`, `bool`, and their nullable versions).

```csharp
app.MapGet("/products", (int? page, string? q) =>
{
    var results = products.AsEnumerable();

    if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(q))
        results = results.Where(p => p.Name.Contains(q, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase));

    var pageNumber = page ?? 1;
    return results.Skip((pageNumber - 1) * 10).Take(10);
});
```

*What just happened:* neither `page` nor `q` appears in the `/products` path, so ASP.NET Core reads them from the query string. `/products?q=mouse` filters by name; `/products?page=2` pages; no query gives defaults because both are nullable (`int?`, `string?`) and arrive as `null` when absent. Nullable types mark a parameter optional.

When the URL name differs from your parameter name, reach for `[FromQuery]`:

```csharp
app.MapGet("/search", ([FromQuery(Name = "term")] string? searchTerm) =>
    $"searching for: {searchTerm}");
```

*What just happened:* `[FromQuery(Name = "term")]` maps the URL's `?term=...` onto a parameter you've named `searchTerm`. You don't need it for the common case, since default binding already does the right thing, but it's there when you want the source spelled out.

## Returning the right status with Results

Returning a raw object is fine until you need to say something other than "200 OK." A by-id lookup that finds nothing should return **404 Not Found**, not `200` with an empty body. A create should return **201 Created**. That's the job of **`Results`** (and its typed sibling `TypedResults`):

```csharp
app.MapGet("/products/{id:int}", (int id) =>
{
    var product = products.FirstOrDefault(p => p.Id == id);
    return product is null
        ? Results.NotFound()
        : Results.Ok(product);
});

app.MapPost("/products", (Product product) =>
{
    products.Add(product);
    return Results.Created($"/products/{product.Id}", product);
});
```

*What just happened:* `Results.Ok(product)` sends the product with a `200`; `Results.NotFound()` sends a `404` with no body. `Results.Created(uri, body)` returns `201` *and* sets the `Location` header to where the new resource lives. `Results` has one method per common outcome: `Ok`, `NotFound`, `Created`, `BadRequest`, more.

`TypedResults` is the same idea with the concrete return type baked in:

```csharp
app.MapGet("/products/{id:int}", (int id) =>
{
    var product = products.FirstOrDefault(p => p.Id == id);
    return product is null
        ? TypedResults.NotFound()
        : TypedResults.Ok(product);
});
```

*What just happened:* behavior is identical at runtime — same status codes, same bodies. The difference is the *type*: `TypedResults.Ok(product)` returns a strongly-typed `Ok<Product>` rather than a general result, easier to unit test and better for tooling. Prefer `TypedResults` for handlers you'll test; `Results` is fine for quick work.

> 💡 A handler can return different result types down different branches. The compiler accepts the `?:` above because `Results.NotFound()` and `Results.Ok(...)` share a common interface, so both branches type-check. With `TypedResults` you'll sometimes declare the return as `Results<Ok<Product>, NotFound>` to keep both concrete types — more on that in later phases.

## Grouping endpoints with MapGroup

As the API grows, every route starts with the same prefix — `/api/v1/products`, `/api/v1/orders`. Repeating `/api/v1` in every `Map` call is noise, and typos creep in. **`MapGroup`** factors out a shared prefix once:

```csharp
var v1 = app.MapGroup("/api/v1");

v1.MapGet("/products", () => products);
v1.MapGet("/products/{id:int}", (int id) =>
{
    var product = products.FirstOrDefault(p => p.Id == id);
    return product is null ? Results.NotFound() : Results.Ok(product);
});
v1.MapPost("/products", (Product product) =>
{
    products.Add(product);
    return Results.Created($"/api/v1/products/{product.Id}", product);
});
```

*What just happened:* `MapGroup("/api/v1")` returns a group object, and every route mapped *on the group* inherits the prefix — no repetition. The immediate payoff is versioning: when `/api/v2` arrives, spin up a second group beside the first, and the two live side by side.

Groups become more powerful later: the same object can attach **authentication, validation filters, and shared metadata** to everything inside it at once. For now, treat `MapGroup` as your tidy prefix — the rest unlocks in the auth and middleware phases.

> 📝 Everything here used **minimal APIs**. ASP.NET Core also has an older, more structured style — **controllers**, classes marked `[ApiController]` with methods decorated by attribute routes like `[HttpGet("products/{id}")]`. Controllers shine in large apps with lots of shared conventions; minimal APIs win on leanness and are the modern default. Not rivals so much as two points on a spectrum — Phase 9 lays them side by side.

## Recap

- A route is an **HTTP method plus a path** pointing at a handler; `MapGet`/`MapPost`/`MapPut`/`MapPatch`/`MapDelete` register them, and the same path with two methods is two distinct routes.
- Handler parameters **bind automatically**: a name that appears in the route (`{id}` → `int id`) comes from the path; one that doesn't comes from the query string. Nullable types (`int?`, `string?`) mark a parameter optional.
- **Route constraints** like `{id:int}` and `{slug:alpha}` decide *whether a route matches* — they are routing filters, not input validation.
- Return a value for the easy case (object → JSON, string → text), or use **`Results`**/**`TypedResults`** to set status precisely: `Ok`, `NotFound`, `Created`, `BadRequest`. `TypedResults` is the testable, strongly-typed variant.
- **`MapGroup`** factors out a shared prefix once (great for `/api/v1` versioning) and later carries shared auth, filters, and metadata for every endpoint inside it.
- Minimal APIs are the modern, lean default; **controllers** are the older structured style — same framework, different ergonomics (full comparison in Phase 9).
