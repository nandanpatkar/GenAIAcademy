# Dependency Injection

Here's the mental model: **you register services in one place, and the framework constructs them and hands them to whatever asks.** You stop writing `new ProductRepository()` scattered through your code. Instead you say, once, "when something needs an `IProductRepository`, give it a `ProductRepository`," and the framework does the wiring — code against interfaces, not `new`.

> 📝 The container that does this wiring is built into ASP.NET Core — nothing to install, no third-party library to bolt on. The moment you call `WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args)`, you already have a dependency-injection container sitting on `builder.Services`, waiting for you to register things.

## Why bother — the problem DI solves

Imagine the products endpoint reaches straight for the data layer:

```csharp
app.MapGet("/products", () =>
{
    var repo = new ProductRepository();   // hard-wired to one concrete class
    return repo.All();
});
```

*What just happened:* the endpoint creates its own repository with `new`. It works, but is welded to that exact class. To test it, you'd hit the real data store; to swap implementations (in-memory for tests, cached in production), you'd edit every place that calls `new`. The endpoint knows *too much* about how a repository gets built.

Dependency injection flips this: the endpoint declares *what it needs* (an `IProductRepository`) and lets the framework decide *what to hand over* and *how to build it*, so it stops caring about construction entirely.

## Step 1: program to an interface

DI works best when you depend on an interface, not a concrete class. Define the contract first, then an implementation:

```csharp
public interface IProductRepository
{
    IEnumerable<Product> All();
    Product? Find(int id);
}

public class ProductRepository : IProductRepository
{
    private readonly List<Product> _products =
    [
        new(1, "Keyboard", 49.99m),
        new(2, "Mouse", 24.99m),
    ];

    public IEnumerable<Product> All() => _products;
    public Product? Find(int id) => _products.FirstOrDefault(p => p.Id == id);
}

public record Product(int Id, string Name, decimal Price);
```

*What just happened:* `IProductRepository` is the contract — the *what*. `ProductRepository` is one *how*. Endpoints depend only on the interface, so the concrete class becomes a swappable detail. (This is the in-memory list from earlier phases, now hidden behind an interface.)

## Step 2: register the service

Now tell the container about the mapping, on `builder.Services`, before `builder.Build()`:

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddScoped<IProductRepository, ProductRepository>();

var app = builder.Build();
```

*What just happened:* You registered a rule: "whenever someone asks for `IProductRepository`, construct a `ProductRepository` and supply it." The two type arguments are the contract and the implementation, in that order. `AddScoped` is *one* of three lifetimes, which control *how often* the framework builds a fresh instance — the next thing to understand.

## Step 3: the three lifetimes

Registering a service answers one question: **how long should a single instance live before the framework throws it away and builds a new one?** Three answers:

| Method | One instance per… | Reach for it when… |
|--------|-------------------|--------------------|
| `AddSingleton` | the whole app | the service is stateless or holds shared, long-lived state (config, an in-memory cache, a clock) |
| `AddScoped` | one HTTP request | the service should be fresh per request — the **default** for data access like a `DbContext` or repository |
| `AddTransient` | every single resolution | the service is lightweight and you want a brand-new one each time it's asked for |

```csharp
builder.Services.AddSingleton<IClock, SystemClock>();           // one forever
builder.Services.AddScoped<IProductRepository, ProductRepository>(); // one per request
builder.Services.AddTransient<IPriceFormatter, PriceFormatter>();    // one each time
```

*What just happened:* three registrations, three lifecycles. `IClock` is built once and shared for the life of the app. The repository is built once *per incoming HTTP request* — two simultaneous requests get two separate repositories, but within one request everyone shares the same one. The formatter is built fresh every time anything asks for it.

> 💡 When in doubt, **`AddScoped` is the sensible default** for application services and anything touching data — it gives each request its own clean instance and lets the framework dispose it when the request ends. Reach for `Singleton` only for genuinely shared state, and `Transient` for cheap, stateless helpers.

## Step 4: consume the service

You registered it — now use it. In a minimal API, you don't fetch the service, you **declare it as a handler parameter** and the framework supplies it:

```csharp
app.MapGet("/products", (IProductRepository repo) => repo.All());

app.MapGet("/products/{id:int}", (int id, IProductRepository repo) =>
    repo.Find(id) is { } product
        ? Results.Ok(product)
        : Results.NotFound());
```

*What just happened:* the handler asks for an `IProductRepository` in its parameter list. The framework recognizes it as a registered service, builds one per its lifetime, and passes it in. You never wrote `new` — swap the registration and every handler quietly gets the new implementation.

In classes — controllers, your own services, background workers — injection happens through the **constructor** instead:

```csharp
public class ProductService
{
    private readonly IProductRepository _repo;

    public ProductService(IProductRepository repo)   // framework supplies this
    {
        _repo = repo;
    }

    public decimal TotalCatalogValue() => _repo.All().Sum(p => p.Price);
}
```

*What just happened:* `ProductService` declares its dependency as a constructor parameter and stashes it in a `readonly` field. When something asks the container for a `ProductService`, the framework sees the constructor needs an `IProductRepository`, builds that too, and passes it in — a chain of construction you never manage by hand.

> 💡 Most minimal-API handlers can tell your services from your bound data by their types. If the framework can't tell whether a parameter is a service or request data, mark it with `[FromServices]`: `app.MapGet("/total", ([FromServices] ProductService svc) => svc.TotalCatalogValue());`.

## The trap: captive dependencies

The pitfall that bites everyone eventually. Lifetimes have a rule: **a service can safely depend on others of the same lifetime or longer-lived ones — but not shorter-lived ones.**

The classic violation is injecting a **Scoped** service into a **Singleton**:

```csharp
// ⚠️ DON'T do this
public class ProductCache
{
    private readonly IProductRepository _repo;   // Scoped...
    public ProductCache(IProductRepository repo) // ...captured by a Singleton
    {
        _repo = repo;
    }
}

builder.Services.AddSingleton<ProductCache>();   // lives for the whole app
```

*What just happened:* `ProductCache` is a singleton — built once, kept forever. But it grabs a `ProductRepository`, which is *scoped* — meant to live for one request and then be disposed. Because the singleton holds onto it, that repository never gets released: it's been **captured**, and every request unknowingly shares the same stale instance. EF Core's `DbContext` — scoped by default — is the textbook casualty; a singleton clutching one surfaces as bizarre data corruption under load.

> ⚠️ Rule of thumb: **never inject something shorter-lived into something longer-lived.** Scoped-into-singleton and transient-into-singleton are the dangerous pairs. The fix is usually to make the outer service scoped too, or — when a singleton genuinely needs per-request work — inject an `IServiceScopeFactory` and create a scope on demand. The built-in container even has a "scope validation" check that throws on these mistakes in development, so it often catches you before production does.

## Why this is the backbone of testable code

Notice what DI bought you. Your endpoints and services depend on `IProductRepository`, never on `ProductRepository`. In a test, you register a fake — an in-memory or stubbed implementation of the same interface — and *every* consumer transparently uses it, no production code changed. The framework also owns the lifecycle: it builds your services, hands them around, and disposes them at the right moment.

That's the payoff: **decoupling** plus **managed lifetimes** — what makes ASP.NET Core code straightforward to test, the muscle you'll flex in [Phase 8: Testing & Production](08-testing-and-production.md).

## Recap

- **The model:** register services in one place; the framework constructs them and supplies them to whatever asks. You code against interfaces, not `new`.
- **Register** on `builder.Services` against an interface, e.g. `AddScoped<IProductRepository, ProductRepository>()` — contract first, implementation second.
- **Three lifetimes:** `AddSingleton` (one per app), `AddScoped` (one per HTTP request — the default for data access like a `DbContext`), `AddTransient` (a new one every resolution).
- **Consume** via handler parameters in minimal APIs and via the **constructor** in classes; use `[FromServices]` to disambiguate when needed.
- **Captive dependency:** never inject a shorter-lived service into a longer-lived one — a Scoped (or Transient) thing captured by a Singleton outlives its scope and breaks under load.
- **Payoff:** decoupling plus framework-managed lifetimes, which is what makes your code testable.
