# What Echo Is & Your First Server

You already know [Go](/guides/go-from-zero), and you've maybe met [Gin](/guides/gin-from-zero) — the
most popular Go web framework. Echo is its closest peer: another fast, focused layer over the standard
library's `net/http`. Echo, like Gin, handles the repetitive parts — routing, JSON, middleware — without
hiding what's underneath.

So why pick Echo over Gin? One design choice, mostly: in Echo, **a handler returns an error**. Not
`func(c *gin.Context)` with no return value, where you write the error response by hand — but
`func(c echo.Context) error`, where you hand the error back and a central handler turns it into an HTTP
response. In a real codebase with dozens of endpoints, that's the difference between every handler
re-implementing "how do I report a failure" and every handler saying `return err` — less boilerplate, and
errors that come out consistent because one place renders them all.

💡 **Echo is net/http with helpers *and* opinions about errors.** The helpers make it fast to write; the
error-return style makes it stay clean as it grows. That's the whole pitch.

## The mental model: instance holds routes, context handles the request, handlers return errors

Before any code, hold three things in your head. They are the entire framework.

📝 **The instance** (`*echo.Echo`, made with `echo.New()`) is your application. You create it once,
register all your routes and middleware on it, and start it.

📝 **The context** (`echo.Context`) is one value handed to you for *each incoming request*. It carries
the request, the response writer, the path and query params, and every helper you use to read input and
write output. Note that `echo.Context` is an *interface*, not a struct — good to know, won't matter today.

📝 **The handler returns an error.** Every handler you write has the shape `func(c echo.Context) error`.
You do your work, then `return c.JSON(...)` on success or `return someError` on failure. Echo's central
error handler decides what the client actually sees.

Say it once: **the instance holds the routes, the context handles the request, and the handler returns
an error.** Everything else in Echo is detail.

```mermaid

  E[echo.Echo<br/>holds the routes] --> R[route<br/>GET /ping]
  R --> H["handler<br/>func(c echo.Context) error"]
  H --> C[echo.Context<br/>reads input, writes output]
  H -.returns error.-> X[central error handler<br/>renders the response]
```

*One idea:* the instance matches an incoming request to a route, calls that route's handler, and the
handler uses the context to send a response — or returns an error for the central handler to render.
Every Echo endpoint flows along those arrows.

## Your first server

First, install Echo into your module. From inside your Go project:

```bash
go get github.com/labstack/echo/v4
```

*What just happened:* `go get` downloaded Echo (the `/v4` is the current major version) and added it to
your `go.mod`/`go.sum`. The import path is `github.com/labstack/echo/v4`; you refer to it in code as the
`echo` package.

Now the smallest server that does something real. Create a file called `main.go`:

```go
package main

import (
    "net/http"

    "github.com/labstack/echo/v4"
)

func main() {
    e := echo.New()
    e.GET("/ping", func(c echo.Context) error {
        return c.JSON(http.StatusOK, map[string]string{"message": "pong"})
    })
    e.Logger.Fatal(e.Start(":1323"))
}
```

*What just happened:* line by line —
- `echo.New()` creates the **instance** and returns a `*echo.Echo`. We name it `e`.
- `e.GET("/ping", ...)` registers a **route**: when a `GET` request arrives for `/ping`, run the
  function we pass. That function is the **handler**, and its signature — `func(c echo.Context) error` —
  is the shape every Echo handler has.
- Inside the handler, `c.JSON(http.StatusOK, ...)` uses the **context** to write the response: sets the
  status to `200`, sets `Content-Type` to `application/json`, serializes the value, and sends it.
  `c.JSON` *returns an error*, and we `return` it — so if writing the response fails, Echo knows. On the
  happy path it returns `nil`, which Echo reads as "all good."
- `http.StatusOK` is the standard library's name for `200`. Echo leans on `net/http`'s constants rather
  than inventing its own.
- `e.Start(":1323")` starts the server listening on port 1323 (Echo's docs use that port; nothing magic
  about it). It blocks until you stop the program. We wrap it in `e.Logger.Fatal(...)` so that if `Start`
  returns an error — say the port is already taken — it's logged and the program exits.

Run it like any Go program:

```bash
go run main.go
```

```console
$ go run main.go

   ____    __
  / __/___/ /  ___
 / _// __/ _ \/ _ \
/___/\__/_//_/\___/  v4
⇨ http server started on [::]:1323
```

*What just happened:* `go run` compiled and started your program, and `e.Start` brought up the server.
Leave it running and, in another terminal, hit the route:

```console
$ curl localhost:1323/ping
{"message":"pong"}
```

*What just happened:* `curl` sent a `GET /ping`. The instance matched it to your route, called your
handler, and the handler used the context to write back JSON — returning `nil` to signal success.

## The error-returning handler, and why it's different

This is the one place Echo and Gin diverge in a way worth pausing on. Put the two handler shapes side by
side:

```go
// Gin: no return value — you write the response (and any error) yourself.
func(c *gin.Context) {
    c.JSON(200, gin.H{"message": "pong"})
}

// Echo: return an error — success or failure flows back to a central handler.
func(c echo.Context) error {
    return c.JSON(http.StatusOK, map[string]string{"message": "pong"})
}
```

*What just happened:* both write the same JSON. But the Echo version *returns* — and that return value is
the hook. When something goes wrong, you don't write a status code and an error body by hand every time.
You return an error, and Echo's central error handler renders it. Echo even gives you a purpose-built
error type for this:

```go
e.GET("/secret", func(c echo.Context) error {
    return echo.NewHTTPError(http.StatusUnauthorized, "you shall not pass")
})
```

*What just happened:* instead of manually setting a `401` status and writing a JSON body, you returned
an `*echo.HTTPError` describing the failure. Echo's default error handler turns it into a clean `401`
response with a JSON message — every endpoint gets the same consistent shape, no copy-pasted error code.

⚠️ Don't worry about *configuring* that central handler yet — that's Phase 6's job, where we wire up a
custom `HTTPErrorHandler` for the books API. For now, just internalize the habit: **in Echo, you
`return` your result, success or failure.** Forgetting the `return` is the rookie Echo bug — the handler
compiles, but nothing gets sent and you stare at a hung request wondering why.

## Adding Logger and Recover middleware

Here's a sharp difference from Gin worth knowing on day one. Gin's `gin.Default()` hands you a Logger and
a Recovery handler already wired up. **Echo's `echo.New()` does not** — it gives you a bare instance.
Logging and panic-recovery are opt-in. Most apps want both, so you add them yourself:

```go
package main

import (
    "net/http"

    "github.com/labstack/echo/v4"
    "github.com/labstack/echo/v4/middleware"
)

func main() {
    e := echo.New()

    e.Use(middleware.Logger())  // a tidy log line per request
    e.Use(middleware.Recover()) // catch panics, return 500, stay alive

    e.GET("/ping", func(c echo.Context) error {
        return c.JSON(http.StatusOK, map[string]string{"message": "pong"})
    })

    e.Logger.Fatal(e.Start(":1323"))
}
```

*What just happened:* `e.Use(...)` registers **middleware** — code that runs around every request. We
imported `github.com/labstack/echo/v4/middleware` (a separate package from `echo`) and added two pieces:
- **`middleware.Logger()`** prints a line for every request — method, path, status, how long it took.
- **`middleware.Recover()`** catches a panic inside any handler, turns it into a clean `500` response,
  and keeps the server running. Without it, one panicking handler takes down the whole process.

We'll cover the middleware signature and write our own in Phase 5. ⚠️ Unlike Gin, Echo doesn't include
these by default — if your server runs silent or dies on a panic, it's because you haven't added them yet.

## The running example: a books API

We won't keep writing throwaway `/ping` routes. Across this guide we'll grow one real service: a small
**books API**. The core of it is a single type — a book with an id, a title, and an author:

```go
type Book struct {
    ID     int    `json:"id"`
    Title  string `json:"title"`
    Author string `json:"author"`
}
```

*What just happened:* we declared the `Book` struct the whole guide builds on. Those `json:"..."`
**struct tags** tell Echo what to call each field in JSON — so `Title` becomes `"title"`, not `"Title"`.
Tags work both directions; binding incoming JSON in Phase 3 leans on them too. Here's the type returning
itself through the now-familiar flow:

```go
e.GET("/books/sample", func(c echo.Context) error {
    b := Book{ID: 1, Title: "The Go Programming Language", Author: "Donovan & Kernighan"}
    return c.JSON(http.StatusOK, b)
})
```

*What just happened:* the handler built a `Book`, and `return c.JSON(...)` serialized it using those
tags — no map needed when you already have a struct.

```console
$ curl localhost:1323/books/sample
{"id":1,"title":"The Go Programming Language","author":"Donovan & Kernighan"}
```

By the end of the guide this grows into full create/read/update/delete over a real collection of books,
with centralized error handling and tests. For now you've met the cast: an **instance**, a **route**, a
**handler that returns an error**, a **context**, and the **`Book`** we'll turn into a proper REST API.
Next up: routing — path params, query params, and grouping routes so they don't sprawl.

## Recap

- **Echo is a fast Go web framework over `net/http`** — a close peer of Gin. It does the repetitive
  parts (routing, JSON, middleware) without hiding the standard library underneath.
- **The mental model is three things:** the **instance** (`*echo.Echo`, from `echo.New()`) holds your
  routes; the **context** (`echo.Context`, an interface) handles each request; the **handler returns an
  error** — `func(c echo.Context) error`.
- **Echo's signature trait is the error-returning handler.** You `return c.JSON(...)` on success or
  `return echo.NewHTTPError(...)` on failure, and a central handler renders it. ⚠️ Forgetting the
  `return` is the classic Echo bug.
- **A first server is tiny:** `echo.New()` makes the instance, `e.GET(path, handler)` registers a route,
  `c.JSON(http.StatusOK, ...)` writes the response, and `e.Start(":1323")` listens. Run with
  `go run main.go`, test with `curl`.
- **Unlike Gin, Echo includes no middleware by default.** Add `middleware.Logger()` and
  `middleware.Recover()` yourself (from `github.com/labstack/echo/v4/middleware`) for request logging
  and crash protection.
- **The throughline:** instance → route → handler → context → response, with errors flowing to a central
  handler. We'll grow one **books API** along that path for the rest of the guide.

## Quick check

Three questions on the ideas that have to stick — what Echo is, the instance/context split, and the
error-returning handler:
