# Testing & Configuration

You've grown the books API from a single attribute route into full CRUD with error catchers. Two questions turn a weekend project into something you'd let other people depend on: *how do I know a change didn't quietly break a route?* and *how do I run this somewhere other than my laptop, with the right port and settings?* This phase answers both.

📝 **Testing and configuration are the two things that make your app portable** — able to run somewhere other than the place you wrote it. A test runs your *real* app in a throwaway, in-process environment so you can poke it and check the answers. Configuration is how that same app behaves differently depending on where it runs — port 8000 on your machine, port 80 in production — without editing code. Both lean on the same trick: building your `Rocket` instance from a function you can call from anywhere.

## The test client: call your app without a server

The fear most people bring to testing a web app is that they'll have to start the server, fire real HTTP requests at `localhost`, then tear it all down — slow, flaky, full of "connection refused" when something didn't boot in time. Rocket sidesteps that.

📝 **Rocket's local `Client` runs your real application in-process and dispatches requests straight to it — no network, no port, no running server.** Hand it the same `Rocket` instance your `main` would launch, call `client.get("/books")`, and Rocket routes that request through your actual handlers, guards, and catchers, then hands you back a response. A function call wearing an HTTP costume — fast (milliseconds) and reliable (nothing to boot, nothing to crash).

There are two flavors. The **blocking** client (`rocket::local::blocking::Client`) is the friendliest for tests — no `async` ceremony. Here's the shape, using the books API:

```rust
use rocket::local::blocking::Client;
use rocket::http::Status;

#[test]
fn list_books_ok() {
    let client = Client::tracked(rocket()).expect("valid rocket");
    let res = client.get("/books").dispatch();
    assert_eq!(res.status(), Status::Ok);
    // res.into_json::<Vec<Book>>() to read the body back as typed data
}
```

*What just happened:* `Client::tracked(rocket())` takes your built application — `rocket()` returns the same builder your `#[launch]` uses (factored out in a moment) — and wraps it in a test client. `client.get("/books")` builds a request; `.dispatch()` runs it through the app and returns the response. We assert on `res.status()`: did it succeed, redirect, 404? The `tracked` part means the client remembers cookies across requests, which matters for login or sessions — `Client::untracked(...)` exists for when you don't care.

To check the *body*, not the status, read it back as typed data:

```rust
#[test]
fn list_books_returns_json() {
    let client = Client::tracked(rocket()).expect("valid rocket");
    let res = client.get("/books").dispatch();

    let books = res.into_json::<Vec<Book>>().expect("valid book list");
    assert!(books.iter().any(|b| b.title == "Dune"));
}
```

*What just happened:* `res.into_json::<Vec<Book>>()` deserializes the response body into your real `Book` type — the same `serde` derive your handlers use, now working in reverse. You get back actual Rust values to assert against: "the list contains a book titled Dune." If the body isn't valid JSON for that type, `into_json` returns `None` and `.expect(...)` fails loudly.

Writing data is the same idea with a request body attached:

```rust
#[test]
fn create_book_returns_201() {
    let client = Client::tracked(rocket()).expect("valid rocket");
    let new_book = NewBook { title: "Hyperion".into(), author: "Simmons".into() };

    let res = client.post("/books").json(&new_book).dispatch();

    assert_eq!(res.status(), Status::Created);
    let created = res.into_json::<Book>().expect("returns the created book");
    assert_eq!(created.title, "Hyperion");
}
```

*What just happened:* `client.post("/books").json(&new_book)` serializes your `NewBook` to JSON and sets `Content-Type: application/json` — the mirror image of the `Json<NewBook>` data guard. We assert the status is `201 Created` and that the response echoes back the created book. This single test exercises routing, the JSON data guard, handler logic, and the responder — the whole vertical slice, no server in sight.

> 💡 There's also an async client, `rocket::local::asynchronous::Client`, same API but `.dispatch().await`. Reach for it when the test itself needs to be `async`. For most route tests the blocking client is less ceremony — start there.

If you've never written a Rust test before — `#[test]`, `assert_eq!`, `cargo test`, Arrange-Act-Assert — see [Your First Unit Test](/guides/your-first-unit-test), and [Testing in CI](/guides/testing-in-ci) for wiring `cargo test` into a pipeline.

## Factor the builder so tests and `main` share one app

Every test above calls `rocket()`. That isn't a coincidence — it's the load-bearing pattern of the whole phase. ⚠️ **If your `#[launch]` function builds the app inline, your tests can't get at it — they'd have to duplicate the build, and a duplicate drifts.** The instant your test app is configured even slightly differently from the real one, your tests are lying to you.

The fix is to build the app in *one* place that both `main` and the tests call:

```rust
use rocket::{Build, Rocket};

fn rocket() -> Rocket<Build> {
    rocket::build()
        .mount("/", routes![list_books, get_book, create_book, delete_book])
        .register("/", catchers![not_found, unprocessable])
        .manage(BookStore::new())
}

#[launch]
fn launch() -> Rocket<Build> {
    rocket()
}
```

*What just happened:* the real assembly — mounting routes, registering catchers, managing state — now lives in `rocket()`, which returns a `Rocket<Build>` (the "configured but not yet launched" stage). `#[launch]` does nothing but call it. Production launches exactly what your tests dispatch against, down to the last catcher. 📝 Same principle as Flask's app factory: one function builds the app, and everything — tests, `main`, later a benchmark harness — asks *it* for a fresh instance. One source of truth, no drift.

## Configuration: `Rocket.toml`, profiles, and env vars

Your app shouldn't hard-code where it runs. Port 8000 is fine on your laptop; production might want port 80, a different bind address, quieter logs. Rocket handles this through **Figment**, its layered configuration system: mostly a `Rocket.toml` file plus environment variables.

📝 **Rocket reads `Rocket.toml` from your project root, split into *profiles* — named sections like `[default]`, `[debug]`, and `[release]` — and the active profile is chosen by how you built the app.** A debug build (`cargo run`) uses `debug`; a release build (`cargo run --release`) uses `release`. `[default]` applies to *every* profile as a baseline, and the active profile overrides it.

```toml
[default]
address = "0.0.0.0"
port = 8000

[release]
port = 80
```

*What just happened:* `[default]` sets the baseline — bind to `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces) on port 8000 — so a normal `cargo run` serves on 8000. Build with `--release` and Rocket layers `[release]` on top, overriding the port to 80 while keeping the inherited `address`. One file describes both environments; the build flag picks which one is live. No `if cfg!(debug)` branching in your code.

The second layer is environment variables, sitting *on top* of the file:

```bash
ROCKET_PORT=9000 cargo run
```

*What just happened:* Rocket reads any `ROCKET_`-prefixed variable as a config override, so this runs on port 9000 regardless of `Rocket.toml` — the env var wins. Common ones: `ROCKET_PORT`, `ROCKET_ADDRESS`, `ROCKET_LOG_LEVEL` (try `=debug` when something's misbehaving, `=off` to silence it). 💡 This precedence — env vars over file over defaults — is exactly what deployment wants: bake sane values into `Rocket.toml`, then let the host override the few that differ (the port a platform assigns you) without rebuilding.

You can also add your *own* keys and read them as a typed struct:

```rust
use serde::Deserialize;

#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct AppConfig {
    catalog_name: String,
    max_books: usize,
}

// inside a fairing or AdHoc::config, given the built `rocket`:
let app_config: AppConfig = rocket.figment().extract().expect("valid app config");
```

*What just happened:* you put `catalog_name` and `max_books` under a profile in `Rocket.toml`, and `rocket.figment().extract()` deserializes the *whole* active configuration into your `AppConfig` struct — your custom keys plus Rocket's own. Same `serde` machinery as your JSON bodies, pointed at config instead. In practice you do this in a fairing (Phase 5) or via `AdHoc::config::<AppConfig>()`, so the parsed config becomes managed state your handlers pull in with `State<AppConfig>`. Type-checked at startup, no scattered `env::var` calls.

## Production: build for release and let the host override

Shipping the books API comes down to a few moves, and you've already met most of the pieces.

**Build for release**: `cargo build --release` compiles with optimizations into `target/release/`, and running that binary activates the `release` profile from `Rocket.toml` — the port-80 setting and any other release tuning come along automatically. **Let the host override what's environment-specific** through `ROCKET_*` vars: a platform that hands you a port at runtime sets `ROCKET_PORT`, and your app obeys without a rebuild.

To run the same everywhere, wrap it in a container. Rust compiles to a single binary, so use a **multi-stage build**: one stage compiles, a tiny final stage carries only the binary.

```dockerfile
FROM rust:1.82 AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN cargo build --release

FROM debian:bookworm-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app/target/release/books-api .
COPY Rocket.toml .
ENV ROCKET_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0
CMD ["./books-api"]
```

*What just happened:* the `build` stage has the full Rust toolchain and compiles your release binary; the final image starts from a slim Debian base and copies *only* the compiled binary and `Rocket.toml` across — the multi-gigabyte compiler toolchain never ships. `ENV ROCKET_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0` makes the server listen on all interfaces inside the container (the default `127.0.0.1` only accepts connections from *within* it). The result is a small, self-contained image that runs identically on your laptop and a cloud host.

⚠️ **Rocket is an application server, not a front door.** In production put a **reverse proxy** (nginx or your platform's load balancer) in front of it to terminate TLS and shield the app from raw internet traffic — Rocket serves plain HTTP behind it. For the full walk from "binary that runs" to "live on a domain with HTTPS," see [Ship Your Side Project](/guides/ship-your-side-project).

💡 Clean testing and clean configuration are the *same* capability wearing two hats: your app is a value you build from one function and run in different contexts — dispatched in-process by a test `Client`, or launched with a release profile behind a proxy. The `rocket()` function you factored out is what makes the app portable enough to ship.

## Recap

1. 📝 **The local `Client` dispatches requests to your real app in-process** — no server, no port. Use `rocket::local::blocking::Client`, `Client::tracked(rocket())`, then `client.get(...).dispatch()`. Assert on `res.status()`; read the body with `res.into_json::<T>()`.
2. **POST tests send a body with `.json(&value)`**, which serializes it and sets the JSON content type — the mirror of your `Json<T>` data guard. There's also an async client (`rocket::local::asynchronous::Client`) for when the test itself is `async`.
3. ⚠️ **Factor the build into a `fn rocket() -> Rocket<Build>`** that both `#[launch]` and your tests call, so production and tests run the *same* app. Inline-built apps force a duplicate that drifts.
4. 📝 **Configure with `Rocket.toml` profiles** (`[default]` baseline, `[debug]`, `[release]`); the build flag (`--release`) picks the active profile. **`ROCKET_*` env vars override the file** (`ROCKET_PORT`, `ROCKET_ADDRESS`, `ROCKET_LOG_LEVEL`) — precedence is env > file > defaults.
5. **Custom config keys** parse into your own struct via `rocket.figment().extract()`, usually in a fairing or `AdHoc::config`, becoming managed state.
6. **Production:** `cargo build --release` activates the `release` profile; let the host set `ROCKET_*`; ship a multi-stage container carrying only the binary; put a reverse proxy in front for TLS.

## Quick check

Three questions on the ideas that matter most before you ship:

  },
  {
    "q": "Why factor app construction into a function like fn rocket() -> Rocket<Build> that both #[launch] and your tests call?",
    "choices": [
      "So tests and production build the exact same app from one source of truth, with no duplicated setup that can drift apart",

    "answer": 0,
    "explain": "If #[launch] builds the app inline, tests have to duplicate the build — and any drift between the two means your tests no longer reflect production. One rocket() function that both call keeps them identical."
  },
  {
    "q": "In Rocket's configuration, what overrides a value set in Rocket.toml?",
    "choices": [
      "A matching ROCKET_* environment variable — env vars sit on top of the file, so ROCKET_PORT=9000 wins over the file's port",
      "Nothing; values in Rocket.toml are final and cannot be overridden at runtime",
      "The [default] profile always wins over every other profile and over env vars",
      "Command-line flags passed to cargo run, which Rocket parses directly"
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explain": "Rocket layers config via Figment with precedence env > file > defaults. A ROCKET_-prefixed env var (e.g. ROCKET_PORT=9000) overrides whatever Rocket.toml says, which is exactly what you want for letting a host set the port at deploy time without a rebuild."
  }
