# Postgres Practice

Six short, hands-on lessons on what Postgres adds on top of standard SQL: a
`JSONB` column for document-shaped data, arrays as a real column type,
`RETURNING` to get a row back from an `INSERT`, `UUID` primary keys generated
with `gen_random_uuid()`, and `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` for upserts. If you've
done the SQL Practice module, this picks up where it leaves off - same
Run-and-check format, but against a genuine Postgres instance (compiled to
WebAssembly, running entirely in your browser - no server, no setup).

Start with lesson 1. You can leave and come back any time - your code is saved locally.
