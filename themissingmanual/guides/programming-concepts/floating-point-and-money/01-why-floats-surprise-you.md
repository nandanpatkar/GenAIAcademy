# Why Floats Surprise You

Let's start at the exact moment it gets weird. You open any language with a console and type the most innocent sum imaginable:

```console
>>> 0.1 + 0.2
0.30000000000000004
```
*What just happened:* The computer added two numbers you'd bet your lunch were `0.1` and `0.2`, and the answer came out wrong in the fifteenth decimal place. Your instinct says "rounding error," and you're right - but the rounding didn't happen during the *addition*. It happened the moment `0.1` and `0.2` were stored, before the plus sign ever ran.

That distinction is the whole guide. So let's see why storing `0.1` is the problem.

## The one idea: a float is a *binary* fraction

You write numbers in base 10. After the decimal point, each place is a tenth, a hundredth, a thousandth - powers of ten. A computer doesn't have base 10; it has base 2. After the (binary) point, each place is a half, a quarter, an eighth, a sixteenth - powers of *two*.

So a float can only store numbers it can build by adding up halves and quarters and eighths. Some decimals fall right out of that:

```text
0.5   = 1/2              → exact in binary
0.25  = 1/4              → exact in binary
0.75  = 1/2 + 1/4        → exact in binary
```
*What just happened:* These decimals are sums of powers of two, so the computer stores them perfectly. No rounding, no surprise. The trouble starts with the ones that *aren't*.

Try to build `0.1` from halves, quarters, eighths, sixteenths… you never land on it exactly. It's like trying to write `1/3` in base 10: `0.3333…` going on forever. In binary, `0.1` is a *repeating* fraction that never terminates:

```text
0.1 in binary = 0.0001100110011001100110011...  (the 0011 repeats forever)
```
*What just happened:* `0.1` has no exact binary form, the same way `1/3` has no exact decimal form. The computer can't store infinite digits, so it keeps about 15–17 significant decimal digits' worth and **rounds off the rest.** What you store as `0.1` is really `0.1` plus a microscopic error.

💡 **Key point.** The error isn't randomness or a CPU flaw. It's the unavoidable cost of writing a base-10 number in a base-2 box. Most decimals don't fit, so they get rounded to the nearest value the box *can* hold.

## Replaying the surprise, now that it makes sense

Go back to `0.1 + 0.2`. Both numbers got rounded slightly when stored. Add two slightly-off numbers and the errors combine, landing you past `0.3`:

```text
stored 0.1  ≈ 0.1000000000000000055511151231257827...
stored 0.2  ≈ 0.2000000000000000111022302462515654...
their sum   ≈ 0.3000000000000000444089209850062616...
nearest 0.3 ≈ 0.2999999999999999888977697537403718...
```
*What just happened:* The true sum of the two stored values is a hair *above* `0.3`, and it's closer to the float just above `0.3` than to the one just below it. So the result displays as `0.30000000000000004`. Nothing went wrong - every step did exactly what it promised. The inputs were never quite `0.1` and `0.2` to begin with.

Here's a cleaner way to *see* that the stored values aren't what you typed. Ask for more digits than the console normally shows:

```python runnable
print(f"{0.1:.17f}")
print(f"{0.2:.17f}")
print(f"{0.1 + 0.2:.17f}")
print(0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3)
```
*What just happened:* Printed to 17 decimals, `0.1` reveals itself as `0.10000000000000001` and the sum as `0.30000000000000004`. And the equality check prints `False` - because the stored sum and the stored `0.3` are two different nearby floats. The default short display had been politely rounding the lie away for you.

## Why it's built this way (and why that's okay)

It would be fair to ask: if base 10 is what humans use, why not store numbers in base 10? The answer is speed and range. The format almost every language uses for `float`/`double` is **IEEE 754** - a binary layout your CPU has dedicated hardware to add, multiply, and divide blindingly fast, and one that covers an enormous range, from subatomic to astronomical, in a fixed 64 bits.

That's a fantastic trade for measuring, simulating, and rendering - places where being off in the 16th digit is invisible and irrelevant. It's a *terrible* trade the moment "off by a hair" means "off by a cent." Which is exactly where we're headed next.

📝 **Terminology.** A *float* (short for *floating-point number*) stores a number as a binary fraction with limited precision. The common 64-bit kind is a *double*. *IEEE 754* is the standard that defines how those bits are laid out. The leftover difference between the number you wanted and the one actually stored is *rounding error.*
