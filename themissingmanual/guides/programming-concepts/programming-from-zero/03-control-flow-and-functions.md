# Making Decisions & Reusing Work: Control Flow & Functions

So far your programs have been a straight line: the computer starts at the top, runs each instruction
once, and reaches the bottom. That's enough to *calculate*, but not enough to *behave*. Real programs do
different things in different situations, repeat work without copy-pasting it, and reuse the same logic
in many places.

Three ideas unlock all of that: **`if`/`else`** (choosing), **loops** (repeating), and **functions**
(reusing). The last one is the most important thing you'll learn as a beginner - saved for the end on
purpose.

## Making decisions with `if` / `else`

**What `if` actually is.** `if` lets the computer choose. You give it a condition - a question that comes
out `True` or `False` (comparison operators, from [Phase 2](02-building-blocks.md)) - and a block of
instructions. The computer runs that block **only if** the condition is `True`; if it's `False`, it
skips the block.

```python runnable
temperature = 35
if temperature > 30:
    print("It's hot out. Drink water.")
```
*What just happened:* The computer evaluated the condition `temperature > 30`. Since `temperature` is
`35`, the condition is `True`, so it ran the indented line. Output:

```console
It's hot out. Drink water.
```

If `temperature` had been `20`, the condition would be `False`, the indented line would be skipped, and
the program would print nothing at all.

Two pieces of grammar are doing real work here, and they confuse beginners until someone points them out:

- **The colon (`:`)** at the end of the `if` line means "here comes the block of instructions that
  belongs to this `if`."
- **The indentation** (the spaces before `print`) is how Python knows which lines are *inside* the `if`.
  Indented lines belong to it; un-indented lines come after and run regardless.

📝 **Terminology.** This family of features - `if`, loops, functions - is called **control flow**,
because it controls the *flow* of execution: which instructions run, in what order, how many times.
Plain top-to-bottom is one path; control flow lets you branch off it.

### `else` and `elif`: the other paths

`if` alone handles "do this when true, otherwise do nothing." Often you want "do this, *otherwise* do
that" - that's `else`. For more than two paths, `elif` ("else if") checks another condition:

```python runnable
score = 72
if score >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif score >= 70:
    print("Grade: B")
else:
    print("Grade: C or below")
```
*What just happened:* The computer checked the conditions top to bottom and took the **first** one that's
`True`, then skipped the rest. `score >= 90`? No (72 is not ≥ 90). `score >= 70`? Yes - so it printed
"Grade: B" and ignored the `else` entirely:

```console
Grade: B
```

That "first match wins, then stop" behavior is the whole point: exactly one branch runs, never two. Order
them carefully - if you'd checked `>= 70` before `>= 90`, a 95 would match the `>= 70` branch first and
never reach the A.

## Repeating work with loops

**What a loop actually is.** A loop runs the same block of instructions more than once. Without loops,
printing the numbers 1 through 5 means writing five `print` lines. With a loop, you write the instruction
once and tell the computer how many times to do it.

The most common loop, the `for` loop, walks through a sequence of values, running its block once per
value:

```python runnable
for number in range(1, 6):
    print(number)
```
*What just happened:* `range(1, 6)` produces the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (it starts at the first value and
stops *before* the second - more on that in a second). The loop ran its indented block once per number,
each time putting the current number into the variable `number`. Five passes, five lines of output:

```console
1
2
3
4
5
```

The same colon-and-indentation grammar from `if` applies: the `:` introduces the block, and the indented
lines are what gets repeated.

⚠️ **Gotcha: `range(1, 6)` stops *before* `6`, not at it.** This catches everyone. `range(start, stop)`
includes `start` but excludes `stop` - so `range(1, 6)` gives you 1 through 5, and `range(0, 3)` gives
you 0, 1, 2. Want 1 through 10? Write `range(1, 11)`. The "stops before the end" rule shows up all over
programming; meet it now and it'll surprise you less later.

Loops aren't just for counting - their real value is doing real work many times. Here's summing a list
of numbers:

```python runnable
prices = [10, 25, 5]
total = 0
for price in prices:
    total = total + price
print(total)
```
*What just happened:* Starting with `total` at `0`, the loop ran once per value in `prices`: `10` makes
`total` `10`, then `25` makes it `35`, then `5` makes it `40`. After the loop finished, we printed the
final `total`:

```console
40
```

📝 **Terminology.** `prices = [10, 25, 5]` is a **list** - an ordered collection of values held in one
variable. Lists are how programs hold "many things," and looping over them is how programs process those
things one by one. (Lists have a lot more to them; that's a topic for
[Data Structures Explained](/guides/data-structures-explained).)

💡 **Key point.** A loop is the cure for copy-paste. Any time you'd be writing nearly the same line over
and over, that's a loop waiting to happen. Write the work once; let the loop repeat it.

## Functions: the most powerful idea you'll learn

Here it is - the idea that does more for a beginner than any other.

**What a function actually is.** A function is a named, reusable block of instructions. You define it
once, giving it a name and the steps it should perform. Then, anywhere you want those steps to run, you
**call** the function by its name, and the computer jumps to the block, runs it, and comes back. You
already met one: `print` is a function someone else wrote that you call. Now you'll write your own.

Why does this matter so much? It lets you name a piece of work and reuse it without repeating yourself.
Think of a function as a recipe card: written once, followed any number of times, without re-explaining
the steps.

```python runnable
def greet():
    print("Hello!")
    print("Welcome to the program.")

greet()
greet()
```
*What just happened:* The `def greet():` block **defined** a function named `greet` - but defining it
doesn't run it; it just teaches the computer the steps. The two `greet()` lines at the bottom **called**
it. Each call ran the function's two `print` lines, so the greeting appeared twice:

```console
Hello!
Welcome to the program.
Hello!
Welcome to the program.
```

📝 **Terminology.** `def` (short for "define") starts a function definition. The name is followed by
parentheses `()` and a colon, and the indented lines beneath are the function's **body** - the
instructions it runs when called. Defining ≠ running: the body only runs when you *call* the function by
name with parentheses.

### Inputs and outputs: parameters and `return`

A function that does the exact same thing every time is useful, but the real power is feeding it
**inputs** and getting a **result** back.

- An **input** is a value you hand the function when you call it (an *argument*, like the text you give
  `print`). Inside the function, that value lands in a named slot called a **parameter**.
- A **result** is a value the function hands back to you, using the `return` instruction.

```python runnable
def add(a, b):
    result = a + b
    return result

answer = add(10, 5)
print(answer)
```
*What just happened:* We called `add(10, 5)`. The computer jumped into the function, putting `10` into
the parameter `a` and `5` into `b`. It calculated `a + b` (`15`), stored it in `result`, and `return`
**handed that value back** to the place that called it. Back outside, `add(10, 5)` became `15`, which we
stored in `answer` and printed:

```console
15
```

`return` is the function's way of *answering*. When the computer hits `return`, it stops the function
immediately and sends that value back to whoever called it. A function with `return` can be used anywhere
you'd use a value - stored, printed, compared, or fed into another function.

⚠️ **Gotcha: `print` and `return` are not the same thing, and confusing them is extremely common.**
`print` puts text on the screen for a *human* to read and hands nothing back to the program. `return`
gives a value back to the *program* so it can keep using it, and puts nothing on the screen. A function
that `print`s its answer but doesn't `return` it can't have that answer used in the next calculation -
it was shown and then thrown away. When a function "works when I print inside it but breaks when I try
to use the result," this is almost always why.

## Putting it all together

Here's a tiny but complete program using every idea from this guide at once. Read it top to bottom, the
way the computer does - you should be able to follow every line:

```python runnable
def grade_for(score):
    if score >= 90:
        return "A"
    elif score >= 70:
        return "B"
    else:
        return "C or below"

scores = [95, 72, 40]
for score in scores:
    letter = grade_for(score)
    print(score, "->", letter)
```
*What just happened:* `grade_for` takes a `score`, uses `if`/`elif`/`else` to decide a letter grade, and
`return`s it. We made a list of three scores and looped over them - for each one, called `grade_for`,
stored the returned letter, and printed the score next to its grade:

```console
95 -> A
72 -> B
40 -> C or below
```

Look at what's working together: a **variable** holds each score; **types** (numbers, strings, the
booleans the comparisons produce) flow through it; **operators** (`>=`) ask the questions;
**`if`/`elif`/`else`** chooses the path; a **loop** repeats the work for every score; and a **function**
bundles the grading logic so it's written once and reused three times. That's not a toy - that's the
shape of real programs. Bigger ones are this, repeated and combined.

## You can now read most code

Take a breath - you've crossed a real line. The five ideas you now hold - values in variables, their
types, operators to combine them, control flow to choose and repeat, and functions to reuse - are the
load-bearing structure of *every* program. Languages differ in punctuation and vocabulary, but open
almost any codebase and you'll see these same five things arranged differently.

You won't understand every line of every program yet - there's plenty more (lists and dictionaries in
depth, files, organizing big programs with classes). But you can now read a block of code, trace what it
does line by line, and reason about it instead of fearing it. That's the skill - everything else is more
vocabulary built on this exact grammar.

## Recap

1. **`if` / `elif` / `else`** run a block based on a condition; the **first** true branch wins and the
   rest are skipped. The `:` and indentation define which lines belong to the block.
2. **Loops** (`for ... in ...`) repeat a block once per value - the cure for copy-paste. ⚠️ `range(1, 6)`
   stops *before* 6, giving 1–5.
3. A **function** (`def name():`) is a named, reusable block of instructions you **call** by name;
   defining it doesn't run it.
4. Functions take **inputs** (arguments landing in parameters) and hand back a **result** with `return`.
   ⚠️ `print` shows a value to a human; `return` gives it back to the program - not the same thing.
5. Real programs are these ideas - variables, types, operators, control flow, functions - combined. You
   can now read them.
