# Regular Expressions, Explained

You've seen them: a wall of slashes, backslashes, and dollar signs like `^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$` -
and your stomach sank a little. Regular expressions have a reputation for being write-only magic
that only wizards understand. That reputation is undeserved. A regex is one small idea wearing a
scary costume, and once you see the idea, the costume stops working on you.

This guide makes regex readable instead of terrifying. We'll start with what a regex *actually is* (a
pattern that describes a *shape* of text), learn the handful of pieces you'll reach for almost every
time, and then meet the real-world traps - greedy matching, escaping, and regex that turns into
gibberish - so they don't bite you.

## How to read this

- **Just need to recognize the pieces?** Skim [Phase 2: The Core Toolkit](02-the-core-toolkit.md) -
  it's a tour of every symbol you'll actually use, each with a tiny example.
- **Want it to finally make sense?** Read in order. Each phase builds on the last, and the whole
  thing rests on the one idea in Phase 1.

## The phases

1. **[What a Regex Actually Is](01-what-a-regex-actually-is.md)** - the mental model: you're
   describing the *shape* of text, not writing code. With a tiny first example you can see match
   and not-match against.
2. **[The Core Toolkit](02-the-core-toolkit.md)** - the pieces you'll use 90% of the time:
   literals, character classes, quantifiers, anchors, and groups - built up to matching something
   real, and an honest word on why "the perfect email regex" is a trap.
3. **[Using Regex for Real (and the Gotchas)](03-using-regex-for-real.md)** - where you meet regex
   (editors, `grep`, code), and the classic traps: greedy vs lazy matching, escaping special
   characters, and regex becoming unreadable - with the cure for each.

> Deeper material - lookahead/lookbehind, backreferences, the differences between regex flavors
> (PCRE vs JavaScript vs POSIX), and catastrophic backtracking - is deliberately left for a
> follow-up guide. You can do an enormous amount of real work with only what's here.
