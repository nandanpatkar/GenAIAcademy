# The Blueprint, Not the Building

Think about the last serious bug you chased. Odds are it wasn't a typo. The code did exactly
what you wrote - the problem was that what you wrote was a faithful implementation of a design
that was wrong. Two operations could interleave in an order nobody pictured. A retry could fire
while the first attempt was still in flight. The logic was sound for the cases you imagined, and
broken for one you didn't.

Here's the uncomfortable part: no amount of careful coding would have saved you, because the
mistake was made before any code existed. It was a flaw in the *idea*. And we almost never write
the idea down precisely enough to inspect it. We jump from a fuzzy mental picture straight to
implementation, and the implementation becomes the first and only place the design is ever
stated in full.

## Coding is not programming

There's a line from Leslie Lamport - the computer scientist behind a lot of this field - that
reframes the whole thing:

> Coding is to programming what typing is to writing.

Sit with that. Writing isn't the act of pressing keys. The thinking - what you're going to say,
how the argument holds together, where it could fall apart - happens before and around the
typing. The typing is the easy, mechanical end. Yet in software we routinely call the typing
"the work" and treat the thinking as something that happens informally, in our heads, in a Slack
thread, in a whiteboard photo nobody looks at again.

A **specification** is where the thinking gets written down. It describes *what the system must
do* and *what must always be true of it* - independent of how the code accomplishes that. It's
the blueprint. The code is the building.

## Why the blueprint is separate on purpose

When you build a house, the architect's drawing is not a tiny house. It's a different kind of
artifact, and that difference is the point. The drawing strips away brick and timber so you can
reason about the thing that matters - does the load-bearing wall actually bear the load? - without
constructing it first and finding out the expensive way.

A spec does the same to software. It throws away everything about *how* (which language, which
data structure, which loop) and keeps only *what*: the states the system can be in, the moves it's
allowed to make, and the properties that must hold no matter what. Stripping the "how" isn't
losing detail - it's removing the noise that hides design flaws.

```text
THE BUILDING (code)              THE BLUEPRINT (spec)
-----------------------          --------------------------------
def transfer(a, b, amt):         A money transfer never creates
    a.balance -= amt             or destroys money:
    b.balance += amt               total balance is unchanged
    # locks? retries?            A transfer never leaves an
    # what if b is frozen?         account below zero
    # what if this crashes
    #   between the two lines?   <- the spec asks: is this EVER
                                    violated, across all orderings
                                    and all failures?
```

*What just happened:* the code on the left is one concrete attempt. The spec on the right doesn't
care how the transfer is implemented - it states the truths the implementation must respect, so
you can ask whether *any* execution could break them, including a crash between the two lines.

## A spec is a blueprint; a test is evidence

This is the distinction that makes the whole field click, so let's be precise about it.

A **test** is evidence. It takes one specific scenario - these inputs, this order - runs it, and
checks the result. A passing test tells you the system behaves correctly *for the case you
thought to write*. That's genuinely valuable. But it's a sample. It says nothing about the cases
you didn't imagine, and the bugs that hurt most are exactly the cases you didn't imagine.

A **spec** is a blueprint. It describes the design as a whole, which means a tool can later
examine *every* situation the design permits - not a sample, the complete space - and report any
that violate your stated properties. (That's Phase 3.) Tests verify the building, one room at a
time. The spec lets you check the blueprint before the building exists.

> Neither replaces the other. You still write tests - they catch coding mistakes, the gap between
> blueprint and building. The spec catches *design* mistakes, the ones tests structurally can't
> reach because you never knew to look.

## This isn't only for rocket scientists

The reputation of formal methods is "PhDs proving theorems about chips." Some of it is that. But
the everyday version is much humbler and more useful: writing the design down in language precise
enough that ambiguity has nowhere to hide. Real engineering teams - at companies running systems
you use daily - have caught genuinely fatal bugs in distributed protocols *at the design stage*,
before writing the code, because they specified first and let a tool poke holes in it. The bugs
were the kind that surface once a year in production and corrupt data when they do. Found on a
laptop in an afternoon instead.

You don't need heavy machinery to start. The core skill is a way of *thinking* - model the system
as states and moves, name what must stay true - and that's exactly what the next phase builds.

## For builders

Next time you're about to implement something with real concurrency or failure modes, try this
before opening your editor: write down, in plain prose, (1) the pieces of state your system has,
(2) the events that can change it, and (3) the one or two things that must *never* stop being
true. You've written a baby spec. Even in prose, the act of stating the invariant out loud
catches design holes - because now you can ask "could this event break that rule?" for each pair,
and that question is where the year-one bug lives.
