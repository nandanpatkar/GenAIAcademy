# The Three Ways We Reason

## You already run three engines

You switch between three completely different kinds of reasoning every day, usually without
noticing the gear change. When you work out that you must be late because the meeting is at three
and it's already 2:55, that's one engine. When you decide your favorite coffee shop is reliable
because it's been good every morning this month, that's a second. When you see your code crashed
and think "the database connection probably dropped," that's a third.

They feel similar from the inside - they all feel like "thinking." But they give you very
different things, and they fail in very different ways. Most muddled arguments come from using one
engine while believing you're using another: treating a good guess as a proof, or treating a pile
of examples as a guarantee.

The three engines are **deduction**, **induction**, and **abduction**. Once you can name which one
you're using, you can ask the right question about it - and that question is the whole game.

## Deduction - from rules to a guarantee

Deduction goes from general rules down to a specific conclusion that is **locked in**. If the
premises are true and the argument is valid, the conclusion *cannot* be false. No wiggle room, no
probability, no "most likely." It's certainty or nothing.

```text
Premise 1:  All prime numbers greater than 2 are odd.
Premise 2:  17 is a prime number greater than 2.
Conclusion: Therefore, 17 is odd.
```

You don't need to go check whether 17 is odd. The conclusion was already sealed inside the
premises the moment you accepted them - the signature of deduction: it adds no new information
about the world, it only makes explicit something the premises already contained. This connects
straight back to Phase 2: a deductive argument is **valid** when true premises force a true
conclusion, and **sound** when it's valid *and* the premises are actually true. Deduction is the
machinery that turns validity into certainty.

📝 **The strength:** certainty. Nothing else on this page can promise that. A correct math proof
is true forever.

⚠️ **The limit, and it's a real one:** deduction only rearranges what you already put in. It
discovers nothing genuinely new about the world, and it's only as trustworthy as its premises -
feed it a false premise and it will hand you a false conclusion with total confidence, because
validity says nothing about whether the premises are true.

**For builders:** a type checker is pure deduction. Given the rules of the type system and the
types in your code, it deduces - with certainty - that you cannot pass a string where an integer
is required. It doesn't *guess*, it proves, within its rules. A mathematical proof of an
algorithm's correctness is the same engine, run by hand.

## Induction - from examples to a probable rule

Induction runs the other direction: from specific observations *up* to a general or probable
conclusion. It's how you learn from experience.

```text
Observation: The sun has risen every morning for all of recorded history.
Conclusion:  Therefore, the sun will rise tomorrow.
```

That's an excellent conclusion - you'd be foolish to bet against it. But notice what kind of
"excellent" it is: it's **probable**, never certain. Nothing about the past *forces* the future.
The conclusion contains more than the premises gave you, which is exactly why induction can teach
you new things - and exactly why it can never guarantee them.

💡 The honest summary of induction: it can be overwhelmingly well-supported and still be wrong.
One genuine counterexample - a single black swan after a lifetime of white ones - breaks a
universal claim no matter how many confirming cases came before it.

🪖 There's a famous illustration called the **turkey problem**. A turkey is fed every single
morning. Day after day, the evidence mounts: humans are generous, life is good, the feeding is
reliable. By every inductive measure the turkey has ever seen, tomorrow will bring more food. Then
comes the morning before Thanksgiving. The turkey's reasoning wasn't sloppy - it was the *best
possible* induction on the data available. The data was incomplete in a way the turkey couldn't
see. That's the permanent risk of induction: you only ever have the observations you've had so
far.

**For builders:** your test suite is induction, and this matters more than it sounds. When your
tests pass, you have *evidence* that the code works - strong, valuable evidence. But passing tests
are inductive **evidence**, not deductive **proof**: you've checked specific cases, you have not
shown the code is correct for every possible input. This is the precise reason a green test suite
can sit on top of a real bug - the failing input was a black swan you never wrote a test for.
Phase 2's gap between "valid" and "true premises" shows up here as the gap between "tests pass" and
"code is correct."

## Abduction - from a clue to the best explanation

Abduction is inference to the *best explanation*. You start with something you observe and reason
backward to the most plausible cause.

```text
Observation:  The grass is wet this morning.
Best guess:   It probably rained last night.
```

But notice - a sprinkler could have run, a pipe could have burst, the dog could have knocked over
a bucket. Rain is the *best available* explanation given what you know, which is not the same as
the *only* explanation, and certainly not a *proven* one. This is the engine doctors use to
diagnose: symptoms come in, and they reason to the most likely underlying condition. It's also,
almost exactly, how you debug.

**For builders:** debugging is abduction in its purest form. You have a symptom - a crash, a wrong
number, a hung request - and you reason backward to the most likely cause. "The page is blank, so
the API call probably failed." That's a hypothesis, the best one given the clue. Good debuggers
know it's a hypothesis: they go *verify* it before acting on it, because abduction's signature
failure is mistaking "best explanation I thought of" for "the correct explanation."

⚠️ **The limit:** abduction is only as good as the set of explanations you considered. If the real
cause never crossed your mind, your "best" explanation is the best of a bad list. The wet grass
really was the sprinkler, and you walked outside without an umbrella.

## The three side by side

The right-hand column is the one to memorize - knowing *where each fails* is what keeps you from
misusing it.

| Engine | Direction of reasoning | What it gives you | Where it fails |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Deduction** | General rules → specific conclusion | Certainty, if premises are true and the argument is valid | Adds no new knowledge; garbage premises → garbage conclusion |
| **Induction** | Specific observations → general/probable rule | New knowledge from experience; probability | Never certain; one counterexample (a black swan) can break it |
| **Abduction** | Observation → most likely cause | The most plausible hypothesis to test | "Best" isn't "only" or "correct," especially if you missed an explanation |

## A grounded note on AI

A large language model is, at its core, an extraordinarily capable pattern-matcher trained to
produce the most plausible-*sounding* continuation of text - in effect, an abduction engine
running at high speed: given your question, it generates the best-sounding explanation or answer.
The catch is the same catch abduction always has: the "best-sounding" answer isn't guaranteed to
be the *correct* one, and the model produces it with the same fluent confidence either way. That's
why a model's answer can read as authoritative and still be wrong - it's abduction without the
verification step a good debugger or doctor insists on. The fix isn't to distrust the tool, it's
to supply the missing step yourself: check the claim, run the code, read the source.

## The three engines, as a set

**Deduction** gives you certainty but no new knowledge. **Induction** gives you new knowledge from
the world but never certainty. **Abduction** gives you the best explanation to investigate but no
promise it's right. Each is powerful in its lane and dangerous when borrowed into another's. Logic
is what gives you the rules for using each one well - when a deduction is valid, when an induction
is well-supported, when an abduction has earned the right to be acted on.

From here, the Logic track gets concrete. You'll meet **propositional logic and truth tables** -
the exact machinery for combining true-and-false statements with *and*, *or*, and *not*. You'll
work through **if-then** reasoning, which trips up more people than any other shape. You'll pick
up **quantifiers** for talking about *all* and *some* without ambiguity, learn what a real
**proof** looks like step by step, and train your eye to **spot fallacies** - the arguments that
feel valid but aren't. The three engines are the *what*. The rest of the track is the *how*.

## Where logic meets its limits: paradoxes

Logic works beautifully - until it meets a statement that turns its own rules against itself.
These are **paradoxes**, and they aren't mistakes - they're signposts that show where the
boundaries of a system are.

The simplest is the **liar paradox**: `"This sentence is false."` If the sentence is true, then
what it says is correct - so it's false. If it's false, then what it says is incorrect - so it's
true. Round and round; no consistent truth value exists.

Why does this matter to you as a builder? Every formal system you use has boundaries, and hitting
them produces bugs that look like nothing else. **Type systems** are logic's answer to Russell's
paradox (the set of all sets that don't contain themselves) - a type error that feels pedantic may
be the compiler protecting you from a contradiction. **Recursion without a base case** is a
practical paradox: a function that calls itself with no way out is a logical loop that never
resolves. **Null / undefined** is a logic gap: a value that is "nothing" breaks the assumption
that every variable holds something you can reason about - that's why null checks are everywhere,
patching a hole in the logical foundation.

Paradoxes don't mean logic is broken. They mean logic has edges, and knowing where those edges
are - and how your tools handle them - is part of reasoning well.

Quick gut-check before you go - for each scenario, name the engine.
