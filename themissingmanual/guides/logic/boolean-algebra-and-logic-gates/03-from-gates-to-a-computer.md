# From Gates to a Computer

You've built a real toolkit: [true and false](/guides/what-logic-actually-is), then AND/OR/NOT as
[an algebra you can combine them with](/guides/propositional-logic), then those operations made
physical as gates in Phase 2. This phase is the payoff - wire a handful of gates together and
watch them do something none of them can do alone: **arithmetic**.

## The question driving this phase

AND, OR, and NOT are about truth - true/false in, true/false out. Addition is about *numbers*:
`2 + 3 = 5`. Those feel like two different worlds. So how does a machine that only knows true and
false add numbers? Nobody snuck a calculator inside - there's no "+" component hiding in the
silicon, only gates. The answer is one of the most satisfying ideas in computing, and you already
have every piece you need.

## Binary addition, recapped

Computers count in binary - only `0` and `1`. Adding two single bits has exactly four cases:

```text
0 + 0 = 0
0 + 1 = 1
1 + 0 = 1
1 + 1 = 10   ← two! doesn't fit in one bit
```

The first three are calm. `1 + 1` is two, and two in binary is `10` - it doesn't fit in a single
bit, so it spills. That spill is the whole game: when a column overflows, the extra `1` moves to
the next column over, the same move you make in decimal (`7 + 5 = 12`, write the `2`, carry the
`1`). So adding two bits produces *two* answers: a **sum** bit (what you write down) and a
**carry** bit (what spills into the next column). Hold onto those two words - we're about to build
a circuit for each.

## The half-adder

One table for both outputs. Inputs `A` and `B`; outputs `sum` and `carry`:

```text
 A   B  | sum  carry
---------+-----------
 0   0  |  0     0
 0   1  |  1     0
 1   0  |  1     0
 1   1  |  0     1
```

Look at each output column on its own. The **sum** column is `0, 1, 1, 0` - `1` when exactly one
input is `1`, `0` when the inputs match. That's precisely XOR:

```text
sum = A XOR B
```

The **carry** column is `0, 0, 0, 1` - `1` only when *both* inputs are `1`. That's AND:

```text
carry = A AND B
```

That's the payoff of the whole guide: no new device, no arithmetic bolted onto the hardware. Two
gates you already knew - one XOR, one AND - wired to the same two inputs, and the pair *adds*.

This circuit is the **half-adder**:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A[A] --> X[XOR]
  B[B] --> X
  A --> N[AND]
  B --> N
  X --> S[sum]
  N --> C[carry]
```

Two inputs fan out to two gates; two outputs come back. That's all it is.

> Why "half"? It can produce a carry *out*, but has no way to accept a carry coming *in* from the
> column to its right. To chain columns together, we need to fix that.

## The full adder

Past a single bit, each column deals with three things: bit `A`, bit `B`, and the carry that
arrived from the column to its right. A **full adder** handles all three - it takes `A`, `B`, and
a **carry-in**, and produces a **sum** and a **carry-out**. You can build one from two half-adders
and an OR gate: fold the carry-in into the mix and ask "did *either* stage produce a carry?" -
that's the OR.

Line up one full adder per bit. The carry-out of each feeds the carry-in of its left-hand neighbor
- exactly how you carry the `1` by hand, column by column:

```text
  bit:    3     2     1     0
        [FA] ← [FA] ← [FA] ← [FA] ← carry starts at 0
         |     |     |     |
        sum3  sum2  sum1  sum0
```

That's a **ripple-carry adder** - the carry ripples leftward through the chain. Want to add 8-bit
numbers? Chain eight full adders. 64-bit? Chain sixty-four. A machine that adds whole numbers is a
row of the same tiny circuit, repeated.

## The leap, honestly

With small variations on the same gates you can also subtract (addition with a flipped sign), and
run AND, OR, and NOT across whole numbers at once. Bundle those operations with logic that picks
*which* one to run, and you've built an **ALU** - an Arithmetic Logic Unit, the part of a
processor that does the math.

An ALU is not a computer, though: it computes an answer the instant its inputs arrive and forgets
it just as fast - no memory, no sense of time. Two more ingredients get you the rest of the way:

- A **memory element** - a small loop of gates called a *latch* that holds a single bit after the
  input goes away. Stack enough of these and you get registers and RAM: somewhere to keep numbers
  between steps.
- A **clock** - a steady tick that says "now," so operations happen in order instead of all at
  once, and a held bit updates only when you want it to.

Add **control logic** - gates that read an instruction and decide what the ALU should do and which
bits go where - and the skeleton of a computer is in front of you: do math (ALU), remember results
(latches), take turns (clock), follow instructions (control). That paragraph is a sketch, not a
build - a real CPU is millions to billions of gates, and each of those four pieces is a deep topic
on its own. But the leap that might have looked like magic, from true/false to a working machine,
is now a list of named, understandable parts. None is a miracle. All are gates.

## For builders

When you write `a + b` in any language, that line ultimately becomes adder hardware doing the
column-by-column carry you just traced. The bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`) are even more
direct - they *are* AND, OR, XOR, and NOT applied across every bit of a number in one shot. The
same world you've been reasoning about on paper runs underneath your code.

## The whole journey

1. **True and false** - the two values everything is built from.
2. **Algebra over them** - AND, OR, NOT, and reliable rules for combining them.
3. **Gates** - those operations made physical, in voltage and silicon.
4. **Arithmetic** - gates wired together until they add, subtract, and beyond.

Each layer was a short, fair step; stacked up, they reach from a single bit to the machine on your
desk. From here it's down into the silicon - how a gate is carved from transistors, how memory and
clocks are built for real. That's a hardware story, but it's the physics underneath the logic you
now understand. You've finished the logic. The foundation is solid, and it's yours.

## Open-ended exercise

A half-adder takes two single-bit inputs (A and B) and produces two outputs: Sum and
Carry. The Sum is `A XOR B` and the Carry is `A AND B`. Now imagine chaining two
half-adders (plus an OR gate) to make a **full-adder** that also takes a carry-in from
a previous stage. Sketch the gate-level diagram for a full-adder, labeling each gate
and showing how the carry propagates. The goal is to see how a multi-bit adder - and
ultimately a CPU's arithmetic unit - is just gates all the way down.

A quick check before you go:
