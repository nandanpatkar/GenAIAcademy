In the [LangSmith UI](https://smith.langchain.com), ensure that your API key is set as a [workspace secret](lc:langsmith/set-up-hierarchy#configure-workspace-settings).

1. Navigate to  **Settings** and then move to the **Secrets** tab.
1. Select **Add secret** and enter the key environment variable (e.g.,`OPENAI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) and your API key as the **Value**.
1. Select **Save secret**.


> [!NOTE]
>
> When adding workspace secrets in the LangSmith UI, make sure the secret keys match the environment variable names expected by your model provider.


> [!NOTE]
>
> If your provider authenticates with OAuth2 `client_credentials`, configure the credentials on the model configuration instead. Workspace secrets are not required in that case. See [OAuth client credentials](lc:langsmith/model-configurations#oauth-client-credentials).


[_Evaluations_](lc:langsmith/evaluation-concepts) are a quantitative way to measure the performance of LLM applications. LLMs can behave unpredictably, even small changes to prompts, models, or inputs can significantly affect results. Evaluations provide a structured way to identify failures, compare versions, and build more reliable AI applications.

Running an evaluation in LangSmith requires three key components:

- [_Dataset_](lc:langsmith/evaluation-concepts#datasets): A set of test inputs (and optionally, expected outputs).
- [_Target function_](lc:langsmith/define-target-function): The part of your application you want to test—this might be a single LLM call with a new prompt, one module, or your entire workflow.
- [_Evaluators_](lc:langsmith/evaluation-concepts#evaluators): Functions that score your target function’s outputs.

This quickstart guides you through running a starter evaluation that checks the correctness of LLM responses, using either the LangSmith SDK or UI.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **A LangSmith account**: Sign up or log in at [smith.langchain.com](https://smith.langchain.com).
- **A LangSmith API key**: Follow the [Create an API key](lc:langsmith/create-account-api-key) guide.
- **An OpenAI API key**: Generate this from the [OpenAI dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

**Select the UI or SDK filter for instructions:**

#### Tab: UI

## 1. Set workspace secrets


## 2. Create a prompt

The [Playground](lc:langsmith/prompt-engineering-concepts#playground) makes it possible to run evaluations over different prompts, new models, or test different model configurations.

1. In the [LangSmith UI](https://smith.langchain.com), click **Playground** in the sidebar.
1. Under the **Prompts** panel, modify the **system** prompt to:

    ```
    Answer the following question accurately:
    ```

    Leave the **Human** message as is: `{question}`.

## 3. Create a dataset

1. Click **Set up Evaluation**, which will open a **New Experiment** table at the bottom of the page.
1. In the **Select or create a new dataset** dropdown, click the **+ New** button to create a new dataset.

![Playground with the edited system prompt and new experiment with the dropdown for creating a new dataset.](/langchain/images/langsmith/images/playground-system-prompt-dark.png)

    

1. Add the following examples to the dataset:

    | Inputs                                                   | Reference Outputs                                 |
    | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
    | question: Which country is Mount Kilimanjaro located in? | output: Mount Kilimanjaro is located in Tanzania. |
    | question: What is Earth's lowest point?                  | output: Earth's lowest point is The Dead Sea.     |

1. Click **Save** and enter a name to save your newly created dataset.

## 4. Add an evaluator

1. Click **+ Evaluator** and select **Correctness** from the **Prebuilt Evaluator** options.
1. In the **Correctness** panel, click **Save**.

## 5. Run your evaluation

1. Select  **Start** on the top right to run your evaluation. This will create an [_experiment_](lc:langsmith/evaluation-concepts#experiment) with a preview in the **New Experiment** table. You can view in full by clicking the experiment name.

> [!TIP]
>
> To learn more about running experiments in LangSmith, read the [evaluation conceptual guide](lc:langsmith/evaluation-concepts).


- For more details on evaluations, refer to the [Evaluation documentation](lc:langsmith/evaluation).
- Learn how to [create and manage datasets in the UI](lc:langsmith/manage-datasets-in-application#create-a-dataset-and-add-examples).
- Learn how to [run an evaluation from the Playground](lc:langsmith/run-evaluation-from-playground).

#### Tab: SDK


> [!TIP]
>
> This guide uses prebuilt LLM-as-judge evaluators from the open-source [`openevals`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/openevals) package. OpenEvals includes a set of commonly used evaluators and is a great starting point if you're new to evaluations. If you want greater flexibility in how you evaluate your apps, you can also [define completely custom evaluators](lc:langsmith/code-evaluator-ui).


## 1. Install dependencies

In your terminal, create a directory for your project and install the dependencies in your environment:

```lc-tabs
[
 {
  "label": "Python",
  "lang": "bash",
  "code": "mkdir ls-evaluation-quickstart && cd ls-evaluation-quickstart\npython -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate\npython -m pip install --upgrade pip\npip install -U langsmith openevals openai"
 },
 {
  "label": "TypeScript",
  "lang": "bash",
  "code": "mkdir ls-evaluation-quickstart-ts && cd ls-evaluation-quickstart-ts\nnpm init -y\nnpm install langsmith openevals openai\nnpx tsc --init"
 }
]
```


> [!NOTE]
>
> If you are using `yarn` as your package manager, you will also need to manually install `@langchain/core` as a peer dependency of `openevals`. This is not required for LangSmith evals in general, you may define evaluators [using arbitrary custom code](lc:langsmith/code-evaluator-ui).


## 2. Set up environment variables

Set the following environment variables:

- `LANGSMITH_TRACING`
- `LANGSMITH_API_KEY`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` (or your LLM provider's API key)
- (optional) `LANGSMITH_WORKSPACE_ID`: If your LangSmith API key is linked to multiple [workspaces](lc:langsmith/administration-overview#workspaces), set this variable to specify which workspace to use.

``` bash
export LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
export LANGSMITH_API_KEY="<your-langsmith-api-key>"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="<your-openai-api-key>"
export LANGSMITH_WORKSPACE_ID="<your-workspace-id>"
```


> [!NOTE]
>
> If you're using Anthropic, use the [Anthropic wrapper](lc:langsmith/trace-anthropic) to trace your calls. For other providers, use [the traceable wrapper](lc:langsmith/annotate-code#use-%40traceable-%2F-traceable).


## 3. Create a dataset

1. Create a file and add the following code, which will:

    - Import the `Client` to connect to LangSmith.
    - Create a dataset.
    - Define example [_inputs_ and _outputs_](lc:langsmith/evaluation-concepts#examples).
    - Associate the input and output pairs with that dataset in LangSmith so they can be used in evaluations.

    

    ```python Python
    # dataset.py
    from langsmith import Client
    
    def main():
        client = Client()
    
        # Programmatically create a dataset in LangSmith
        dataset = client.create_dataset(
            dataset_name="Sample dataset",
            description="A sample dataset in LangSmith."
        )
    
        # Create examples
        examples = [
            {
                "inputs": {"question": "Which country is Mount Kilimanjaro located in?"},
                "outputs": {"answer": "Mount Kilimanjaro is located in Tanzania."},
            },
            {
                "inputs": {"question": "What is Earth's lowest point?"},
                "outputs": {"answer": "Earth's lowest point is The Dead Sea."},
            },
        ]
    
        # Add examples to the dataset
        client.create_examples(dataset_id=dataset.id, examples=examples)
        print("Created dataset:", dataset.name)
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    

1. In your terminal, run the `dataset` file to create the datasets you'll use to evaluate your app:

    
    ```lc-tabs
    [
     {
      "label": "Python",
      "lang": "bash",
      "code": "python dataset.py"
     },
     {
      "label": "TypeScript",
      "lang": "bash",
      "code": "npx ts-node dataset.ts"
     }
    ]
    ```

    

    You'll see the following output:

    ```bash
    Created dataset: Sample dataset
    ```

## 4. Create your target function

Define a [target function](lc:langsmith/define-target-function) that contains what you're evaluating. In this guide, you'll define a target function that contains a single LLM call to answer a question.

Add the following to an `eval` file:

```python Python
# eval.py
from langsmith import Client, wrappers
from openai import OpenAI

# Wrap the OpenAI client for LangSmith tracing
openai_client = wrappers.wrap_openai(OpenAI())

# Define the application logic you want to evaluate inside a target function
# The SDK will automatically send the inputs from the dataset to your target function
def target(inputs: dict) -> dict:
    response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-5-mini",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "Answer the following question accurately"},
            {"role": "user", "content": inputs["question"]},
        ],
    )
    return {"answer": response.choices[0].message.content.strip()}
```

## 5. Define an evaluator

In this step, you’re telling LangSmith how to grade the answers your app produces.

Import a prebuilt evaluation prompt (`CORRECTNESS_PROMPT`) from [`openevals`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/openevals) and a helper that wraps it into an [_LLM-as-judge evaluator_](lc:langsmith/evaluation-concepts#llm-as-judge), which will score the application's output.


> [!NOTE]
>
> `CORRECTNESS_PROMPT` is just an f-string with variables for `"inputs"`, `"outputs"`, and `"reference_outputs"`. See [customizing OpenEvals prompts](https://github.com/langchain-ai/openevals#customizing-prompts) for more information.


The evaluator compares:

- `inputs`: what was passed into your target function (e.g., the question text).
- `outputs`: what your target function returned (e.g., the model’s answer).
- `reference_outputs`: the ground truth answers you attached to each dataset example in [Step 3](#3-create-a-dataset).

Add the following highlighted code to your `eval` file:

```python Python highlight={3,4,21-31}
from langsmith import Client, wrappers
from openai import OpenAI
from openevals.llm import create_llm_as_judge
from openevals.prompts import CORRECTNESS_PROMPT

# Wrap the OpenAI client for LangSmith tracing
openai_client = wrappers.wrap_openai(OpenAI())

# Define the application logic you want to evaluate inside a target function
# The SDK will automatically send the inputs from the dataset to your target function
def target(inputs: dict) -> dict:
    response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-5-mini",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "Answer the following question accurately"},
            {"role": "user", "content": inputs["question"]},
        ],
    )
    return {"answer": response.choices[0].message.content.strip()}

def correctness_evaluator(inputs: dict, outputs: dict, reference_outputs: dict):
    evaluator = create_llm_as_judge(
        prompt=CORRECTNESS_PROMPT,
        model="openai:o3-mini",
        feedback_key="correctness",
    )
    return evaluator(
        inputs=inputs,
        outputs=outputs,
        reference_outputs=reference_outputs
    )
```

## 6. Run and view results

To run the evaluation experiment, you'll call `evaluate(...)`, which:

- Pulls example from the dataset you created in [Step 3](#3-create-a-dataset).
- Sends each example's inputs to your target function from [Step 4](#4-add-an-evaluator).
- Collects the outputs (the model's answers).
- Passes the outputs along with the `reference_outputs` to your evaluator from [Step 5](#5-define-an-evaluator).
- Records all results in LangSmith as an experiment, so you can view them in the UI.

1. Add the highlighted code to your `eval` file:

    

    ```python Python highlight={33-49}
    from langsmith import Client, wrappers
    from openai import OpenAI
    from openevals.llm import create_llm_as_judge
    from openevals.prompts import CORRECTNESS_PROMPT
    
    # Wrap the OpenAI client for LangSmith tracing
    openai_client = wrappers.wrap_openai(OpenAI())
    
    # Define the application logic you want to evaluate inside a target function
    # The SDK will automatically send the inputs from the dataset to your target function
    def target(inputs: dict) -> dict:
        response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-5-mini",
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": "Answer the following question accurately"},
                {"role": "user", "content": inputs["question"]},
            ],
        )
        return {"answer": response.choices[0].message.content.strip()}
    
    def correctness_evaluator(inputs: dict, outputs: dict, reference_outputs: dict):
        evaluator = create_llm_as_judge(
            prompt=CORRECTNESS_PROMPT,
            model="openai:o3-mini",
            feedback_key="correctness",
        )
        return evaluator(
            inputs=inputs,
            outputs=outputs,
            reference_outputs=reference_outputs
        )
    
    # After running the evaluation, a link will be provided to view the results in langsmith
    def main():
        client = Client()
        experiment_results = client.evaluate(
            target,
            data="Sample dataset",
            evaluators=[
                correctness_evaluator,
                # can add multiple evaluators here
            ],
            experiment_prefix="first-eval-in-langsmith",
            max_concurrency=2,
        )
        print(experiment_results)
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    

1. Run your evaluator:

    

    ```lc-tabs
    [
     {
      "label": "Python",
      "lang": "bash",
      "code": "python eval.py"
     },
     {
      "label": "TypeScript",
      "lang": "bash",
      "code": "npx ts-node eval.ts"
     }
    ]
    ```

    

1. You'll receive a link to view the evaluation results and metadata for the experiment results:

    ```
    View the evaluation results for experiment: 'first-eval-in-langsmith-00000000' at: https://smith.langchain.com/o/6551f9c4-2685-4a08-86b9-1b29643deb3d/datasets/e5fde557-c274-4e49-b39d-000000000000/compare?selectedSessions=70b11778-6a28-4cdb-be81-000000000000

    <ExperimentResults first-eval-in-langsmith-00000000>
    ```

1. Follow the link in the output of your evaluation run to access the **Datasets & Experiments** page in the [LangSmith UI](https://smith.langchain.com), and explore the results of the experiment. This will direct you to the created experiment with a table showing the **Inputs**, **Reference Output**, and **Outputs**. You can select a dataset to open an expanded view of the results.
