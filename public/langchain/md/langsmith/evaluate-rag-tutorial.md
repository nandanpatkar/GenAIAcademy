Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing them with relevant external knowledge. It has become one of the most widely used approaches for building LLM applications. To build a RAG application first, see [RAG with Deep Agents](lc:oss/python/deepagents/rag).

This tutorial shows how to evaluate RAG applications with LangSmith:

1. How to create test datasets
2. How to run your RAG application on those datasets
3. How to measure your application's performance using different evaluation metrics

## Overview

A typical RAG evaluation workflow has three steps:

1. Create a dataset of questions and expected answers.
2. Run the RAG application on those questions.
3. Score results with [evaluators](lc:langsmith/evaluators) for answer relevance, answer accuracy, and retrieval quality.

This tutorial builds and evaluates a bot that answers questions about a few of [Lilian Weng's](https://lilianweng.github.io/) blog posts.

## Setup

### Configure the environment

Set environment variables:

```python Python
os.environ["LANGSMITH_TRACING"] = "true"
os.environ["LANGSMITH_API_KEY"] = "YOUR LANGSMITH API KEY"
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR OPENAI API KEY"
```

Install dependencies:

```lc-tabs
[
 {
  "label": "Python",
  "lang": "bash",
  "code": "pip install -U langsmith langchain[openai] langchain-text-splitters bs4 requests"
 },
 {
  "label": "npm",
  "lang": "bash",
  "code": "npm i langsmith langchain @langchain/classic @langchain/openai @langchain/textsplitters cheerio"
 },
 {
  "label": "yarn",
  "lang": "bash",
  "code": "yarn add langsmith langchain @langchain/classic @langchain/openai @langchain/textsplitters cheerio"
 },
 {
  "label": "pnpm",
  "lang": "bash",
  "code": "pnpm add langsmith langchain @langchain/classic @langchain/openai @langchain/textsplitters cheerio"
 }
]
```

### Build the application


> [!NOTE]
>
> This tutorial uses LangChain, but the evaluation patterns work with any framework.


Build a minimal RAG app with three stages:

- **Indexing**: Chunk and index a few of Lilian Weng's blogs in a vector store.
- **Retrieval**: Retrieve chunks for the user question.
- **Generation**: Pass the question and retrieved documents to an LLM.

#### Index documents

Load the blog posts and index them:


```python Python
from langchain_core.documents import Document
from langchain_core.vectorstores import InMemoryVectorStore
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

# Below is a minimal helper for demonstration purposes.
def load_web_page(url: str, bs_kwargs: dict | None = None) -> list[Document]:
    response = requests.get(url)
    response.raise_for_status()
    soup = bs4.BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser", **(bs_kwargs or {}))
    return [Document(page_content=soup.get_text(), metadata={"source": url})]

# List of URLs to load documents from
urls = [
    "https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/",
    "https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-03-15-prompt-engineering/",
    "https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-adv-attack-llm/",
]

# Load documents from the URLs
bs4_strainer = bs4.SoupStrainer(class_=("post-title", "post-header", "post-content"))
docs_list = [
    doc
    for url in urls
    for doc in load_web_page(url, bs_kwargs={"parse_only": bs4_strainer})
]

# Initialize a text splitter with specified chunk size and overlap
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.from_tiktoken_encoder(
    chunk_size=250, chunk_overlap=0
)

# Split the documents into chunks
doc_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs_list)

# Add the document chunks to the "vector store" using OpenAIEmbeddings
vectorstore = InMemoryVectorStore.from_documents(
    documents=doc_splits,
    embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings(),
)

# With langchain we can easily turn any vector store into a retrieval component:
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(k=6)
```


#### Generate answers

Define the generative pipeline:


```python Python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langsmith import traceable

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-5.5", temperature=1)

# Add decorator so this function is traced in LangSmith
@traceable()
def rag_bot(question: str) -> dict:
    # LangChain retriever will be automatically traced
    docs = retriever.invoke(question)
    docs_string = "".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs)
    instructions = f"""You are a helpful assistant who is good at analyzing source information and answering questions.
       Use the following source documents to answer the user's questions.
       If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know.
       Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.

<context>
{docs_string}
</context>"""
    # langchain ChatModel will be automatically traced
    ai_msg = llm.invoke([
            {"role": "system", "content": instructions},
            {"role": "user", "content": question},
        ],
    )
    return {"answer": ai_msg.content, "documents": docs}
```


## Create a dataset

Now that you have your application, create a small dataset of example questions and reference answers to evaluate it. This example uses an example set of inputs and outputs:


```python Python
from langsmith import Client

client = Client()

# Define the examples for the dataset
examples = [
    {
        "inputs": {"question": "How does the ReAct agent use self-reflection? "},
        "outputs": {"answer": "ReAct integrates reasoning and acting, performing actions - such tools like Wikipedia search API - and then observing / reasoning about the tool outputs."},
    },
    {
        "inputs": {"question": "What are the types of biases that can arise with few-shot prompting?"},
        "outputs": {"answer": "The biases that can arise with few-shot prompting include (1) Majority label bias, (2) Recency bias, and (3) Common token bias."},
    },
    {
        "inputs": {"question": "What are five types of adversarial attacks?"},
        "outputs": {"answer": "Five types of adversarial attacks are (1) Token manipulation, (2) Gradient based attack, (3) Jailbreak prompting, (4) Human red-teaming, (5) Model red-teaming."},
    },
]

# Create the dataset and examples in LangSmith
dataset_name = "Lilian Weng Blogs Q&A"
dataset = client.create_dataset(dataset_name=dataset_name)
client.create_examples(
    dataset_id=dataset.id,
    examples=examples
)
```


## Define evaluators

RAG evaluators compare one artifact to another (response, input, retrieved docs, or reference answer):

1. **[Correctness](#correctness-response-vs-reference-answer)** (response vs reference answer)
   - **Goal**: Score how similar the RAG answer is to a ground-truth answer.
   - **Mode**: Requires a reference answer in the dataset.
   - **Evaluator**: LLM-as-judge for answer correctness.

2. **[Relevance](#relevance-response-vs-input)** (response vs input)
   - **Goal**: Score how well the response addresses the user question.
   - **Mode**: No reference answer; compares the answer to the input.
   - **Evaluator**: LLM-as-judge for relevance and helpfulness.

3. **[Groundedness](#groundedness-response-vs-retrieved-docs)** (response vs retrieved docs)
   - **Goal**: Score how well the response agrees with the retrieved context.
   - **Mode**: No reference answer; compares the answer to retrieved documents.
   - **Evaluator**: LLM-as-judge for faithfulness and hallucinations.

4. **[Retrieval relevance](#retrieval-relevance-retrieved-docs-vs-input)** (retrieved docs vs input)
   - **Goal**: Score how relevant the retrieved documents are to the query.
   - **Mode**: No reference answer; compares the question to retrieved documents.
   - **Evaluator**: LLM-as-judge for retrieval relevance.

For more on these evaluator types, see [Evaluate RAG applications](lc:langsmith/evaluation-approaches#evaluate-rag-applications).

![Rag eval overview](/langchain/images/langsmith/images/rag-eval-overview.png)

### Correctness: Response vs reference answer

Use an LLM-as-judge to compare the generated answer to the reference answer in the dataset:


```python Python
from typing_extensions import Annotated, TypedDict

# Grade output schema
class CorrectnessGrade(TypedDict):
    # Note that the order in the fields are defined is the order in which the model will generate them.
    # It is useful to put explanations before responses because it forces the model to think through
    # its final response before generating it:
    explanation: Annotated[str, ..., "Explain your reasoning for the score"]
    correct: Annotated[bool, ..., "True if the answer is correct, False otherwise."]

# Grade prompt
correctness_instructions = """You are a teacher grading a quiz. You will be given a QUESTION, the GROUND TRUTH (correct) ANSWER, and the STUDENT ANSWER. Here is the grade criteria to follow:
(1) Grade the student answers based ONLY on their factual accuracy relative to the ground truth answer. (2) Ensure that the student answer does not contain any conflicting statements.
(3) It is OK if the student answer contains more information than the ground truth answer, as long as it is factually accurate relative to the  ground truth answer.

Correctness:
A correctness value of True means that the student's answer meets all of the criteria.
A correctness value of False means that the student's answer does not meet all of the criteria.

Explain your reasoning in a step-by-step manner to ensure your reasoning and conclusion are correct. Avoid simply stating the correct answer at the outset."""

# Grader LLM
grader_llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-5.5", temperature=0).with_structured_output(
    CorrectnessGrade, method="json_schema", strict=True
)

def correctness(inputs: dict, outputs: dict, reference_outputs: dict) -> bool:
    """An evaluator for RAG answer accuracy"""
    answers = f"""\
QUESTION: {inputs['question']}
GROUND TRUTH ANSWER: {reference_outputs['answer']}
STUDENT ANSWER: {outputs['answer']}"""
    # Run evaluator
    grade = grader_llm.invoke([
        {"role": "system", "content": correctness_instructions},
        {"role": "user", "content": answers}
    ])
    return grade["correct"]
```


### Relevance: Response vs input

Compare `inputs` and `outputs` without `reference_outputs`. You cannot score accuracy without a reference answer, but you can still score whether the model addressed the question:


```python Python
# Grade output schema
class RelevanceGrade(TypedDict):
    explanation: Annotated[str, ..., "Explain your reasoning for the score"]
    relevant: Annotated[
        bool, ..., "Provide the score on whether the answer addresses the question"
    ]

# Grade prompt
relevance_instructions = """You are a teacher grading a quiz. You will be given a QUESTION and a STUDENT ANSWER. Here is the grade criteria to follow:
(1) Ensure the STUDENT ANSWER is concise and relevant to the QUESTION
(2) Ensure the STUDENT ANSWER helps to answer the QUESTION

Relevance:
A relevance value of True means that the student's answer meets all of the criteria.
A relevance value of False means that the student's answer does not meet all of the criteria.

Explain your reasoning in a step-by-step manner to ensure your reasoning and conclusion are correct. Avoid simply stating the correct answer at the outset."""

# Grader LLM
relevance_llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-5.5", temperature=0).with_structured_output(
    RelevanceGrade, method="json_schema", strict=True
)

# Evaluator
def relevance(inputs: dict, outputs: dict) -> bool:
    """A simple evaluator for RAG answer helpfulness."""
    answer = f"QUESTION: {inputs['question']}\nSTUDENT ANSWER: {outputs['answer']}"
    grade = relevance_llm.invoke([
        {"role": "system", "content": relevance_instructions},
        {"role": "user", "content": answer}
    ])
    return grade["relevant"]
```


### Groundedness: Response vs retrieved docs

Another useful way to evaluate responses is to check whether the response is justified by (grounded in) the retrieved documents, without a reference answer:


```python Python
# Grade output schema
class GroundedGrade(TypedDict):
    explanation: Annotated[str, ..., "Explain your reasoning for the score"]
    grounded: Annotated[
        bool, ..., "Provide the score on if the answer hallucinates from the documents"
    ]

# Grade prompt
grounded_instructions = """You are a teacher grading a quiz. You will be given FACTS and a STUDENT ANSWER. Here is the grade criteria to follow:
(1) Ensure the STUDENT ANSWER is grounded in the FACTS. (2) Ensure the STUDENT ANSWER does not contain "hallucinated" information outside the scope of the FACTS.

Grounded:
A grounded value of True means that the student's answer meets all of the criteria.
A grounded value of False means that the student's answer does not meet all of the criteria.

Explain your reasoning in a step-by-step manner to ensure your reasoning and conclusion are correct. Avoid simply stating the correct answer at the outset."""

# Grader LLM
grounded_llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-5.5", temperature=0).with_structured_output(
    GroundedGrade, method="json_schema", strict=True
)

# Evaluator
def groundedness(inputs: dict, outputs: dict) -> bool:
    """A simple evaluator for RAG answer groundedness."""
    doc_string = "\n\n".join(doc.page_content for doc in outputs["documents"])
    answer = f"FACTS: {doc_string}\nSTUDENT ANSWER: {outputs['answer']}"
    grade = grounded_llm.invoke([
        {"role": "system", "content": grounded_instructions},
        {"role": "user", "content": answer}
    ])
    return grade["grounded"]
```


### Retrieval relevance: Retrieved docs vs input

Use an LLM-as-judge to score whether the retrieved documents are relevant to the user question:


```python Python
# Grade output schema
class RetrievalRelevanceGrade(TypedDict):
    explanation: Annotated[str, ..., "Explain your reasoning for the score"]
    relevant: Annotated[
        bool,
        ...,
        "True if the retrieved documents are relevant to the question, False otherwise",
    ]

# Grade prompt
retrieval_relevance_instructions = """You are a teacher grading a quiz. You will be given a QUESTION and a set of FACTS provided by the student. Here is the grade criteria to follow:
(1) You goal is to identify FACTS that are completely unrelated to the QUESTION
(2) If the facts contain ANY keywords or semantic meaning related to the question, consider them relevant
(3) It is OK if the facts have SOME information that is unrelated to the question as long as (2) is met

Relevance:
A relevance value of True means that the FACTS contain ANY keywords or semantic meaning related to the QUESTION and are therefore relevant.
A relevance value of False means that the FACTS are completely unrelated to the QUESTION.

Explain your reasoning in a step-by-step manner to ensure your reasoning and conclusion are correct. Avoid simply stating the correct answer at the outset."""

# Grader LLM
retrieval_relevance_llm = ChatOpenAI(
    model="gpt-5.5", temperature=0
).with_structured_output(RetrievalRelevanceGrade, method="json_schema", strict=True)

def retrieval_relevance(inputs: dict, outputs: dict) -> bool:
    """An evaluator for document relevance"""
    doc_string = "\n\n".join(doc.page_content for doc in outputs["documents"])
    answer = f"FACTS: {doc_string}\nQUESTION: {inputs['question']}"
    # Run evaluator
    grade = retrieval_relevance_llm.invoke([
        {"role": "system", "content": retrieval_relevance_instructions},
        {"role": "user", "content": answer}
    ])
    return grade["relevant"]
```


## Run the evaluation

Run the evaluation with all of the evaluators:


```python Python
def target(inputs: dict) -> dict:
    return rag_bot(inputs["question"])

experiment_results = client.evaluate(
    target,
    data=dataset_name,
    evaluators=[correctness, groundedness, relevance, retrieval_relevance],
    experiment_prefix="rag-doc-relevance",
    metadata={"version": "LCEL context, gpt-4-0125-preview"},
)

# Explore results locally as a dataframe if you have pandas installed
# experiment_results.to_pandas()
```
