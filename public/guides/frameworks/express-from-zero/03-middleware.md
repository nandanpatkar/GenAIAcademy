# Middleware

The secret that makes Express click: there is no separate "middleware feature" bolted on the side.
Middleware *is* Express. Routing is middleware. Body parsing is middleware. Auth, logging, error
handling — all the same shape. Once you see it, the framework stops being a pile of methods to
memorize and becomes one idea you understand all the way down.

## The mental model: a chain of `(req, res, next)` functions

📝 Picture a request walking through a hallway of doors. Each door is a function with three things:
`req` (what came in), `res` (what you'll send back), and `next` (a doorknob that opens the next door).

At each door, the function does one of three things:

1. **Read or modify** `req`/`res`, then call `next()` to pass the request along.
2. **End the response** itself (`res.send(...)`, `res.json(...)`) — the request stops here.
3. **Call `next()`** with nothing changed, just to hand off.

A middleware function looks exactly like this:

```javascript
function myMiddleware(req, res, next) {
  // ...do something with req or res...
  next(); // open the next door
}
```

*What just happened:* three parameters, and a decision about whether to call `next()` — the shape of
every middleware in Express. A route handler like `app.get('/tasks', (req, res) => ...)` is the same
thing; it just happens to be the *last* door, so it sends a response instead of calling `next()`.
Routes are middleware bound to a method and a path.

💡 If you read [Build a Server with node:http](/guides/build-a-server-with-node-http), you already met
`(req, res)` and "call the next function to keep going." Express didn't invent this — it formalized it.

## Writing your first middleware: a request logger

The classic first middleware logs every request: method, URL, status, and duration.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

function logger(req, res, next) {
  const start = Date.now();
  res.on('finish', () => {
    console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url} ${res.statusCode} ${Date.now() - start}ms`);
  });
  next(); // hand off to the next middleware
}

app.use(logger); // runs for EVERY request

app.get('/tasks', (req, res) => {
  res.json([{ id: 1, title: 'Write the docs' }]);
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('http://localhost:3000'));
```

*What just happened:* `app.use(logger)` registers `logger` to run at the start of every request. We
record `start`, then attach a one-time listener to `res`'s `'finish'` event — fired when the response
is fully sent — so we can log the real status code and duration. `logger` calls `next()` immediately;
it doesn't wait for `finish`. Its job in the chain is to step aside and let the request continue. Hit
`GET /tasks` and you'll see `GET /tasks 200 2ms`.

### Three places you can register middleware

```javascript
app.use(logger);                          // GLOBAL: every request
app.use('/admin', requireLogin);          // PATH-SCOPED: only paths under /admin
app.get('/tasks/:id', loadTask, handler); // PER-ROUTE: only this route, in this order
```

*What just happened:* same mechanism, three reaches. `app.use(fn)` runs on everything. `app.use('/admin', fn)`
runs only when the path starts with `/admin`. Listing functions inside a route runs them left to right
for that one route. The middleware doesn't change — only *where you mount it* does.

## ⚠️ Order matters (this is the part that bites everyone)

Middleware runs **in the order you register it**, top to bottom. Getting this wrong is the most
common Express bug there is.

**Trap 1: the parser must come before the routes that need it.** `express.json()` reads the request
body into `req.body`. Register your routes *before* it, and `req.body` is `undefined` there.

```javascript
// ❌ WRONG — route runs before the body is parsed
app.post('/tasks', (req, res) => {
  res.json(req.body); // undefined — nothing parsed it yet
});
app.use(express.json());

// ✅ RIGHT — parse first, then route
app.use(express.json());
app.post('/tasks', (req, res) => {
  res.json(req.body); // { title: "..." } — parsed and ready
});
```

*What just happened:* in the wrong version, the handler runs before `express.json()` has parsed
anything, so `req.body` is `undefined`. In the right version, parsing happens earlier in the chain, so
by the time your handler runs, `req.body` is already populated. Order on the page = order at runtime.

**Trap 2: forgetting `next()` hangs the request.** A middleware that neither responds nor calls
`next()` is a closed door with no knob — the request stands there forever, until the client times out.

```javascript
// ❌ This middleware silently hangs every request
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('checking request...');
  // no next(), no res.send() — DEAD END
});
```

*What just happened:* this is the number-one beginner bug. The function logs and returns, but never
calls `next()` or sends a response, so Express has no way to know it's done. Every middleware must do
exactly one of two things: **respond**, or **call `next()`**. If a request hangs for no reason, check
for a missing `next()` first.

## Built-in and third-party middleware

You rarely write parsers and security headers yourself — you reach for middleware that already exists.

**Built into Express:**

- `express.json()` — parses JSON request bodies into `req.body`.
- `express.urlencoded({ extended: true })` — parses HTML form submissions into `req.body`.
- `express.static('public')` — serves files from a folder (images, CSS, the front end).

**Popular third-party packages** (install with npm, then `app.use(...)` them):

- `cors` — adds the headers browsers need to allow cross-origin requests.
- `morgan` — a polished request logger (like ours, but configurable).
- `helmet` — sets a bundle of security-related HTTP headers.

```javascript
const cors = require('cors');
const helmet = require('helmet');

app.use(helmet());          // security headers on every response
app.use(cors());            // allow cross-origin requests
app.use(express.json());    // parse JSON bodies
app.use(morgan('dev'));     // log requests
```

*What just happened:* each line plugs a ready-made middleware into the chain, listed near the top so
they run early — security headers and CORS should apply to every response, and `express.json()` must
come before any route reading `req.body` (Trap 1). Helmet, cors, json, a logger: the boring, sensible
opening for most real Express apps.

### Passing data down the chain with `req`

Middleware can **attach things to `req`**, and every later function in the chain can read them. The
textbook case is authentication: one middleware checks who's calling and stashes the user on `req`.

```javascript
function requireAuth(req, res, next) {
  const token = req.headers['authorization'];
  if (!token) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Not authenticated' });
    // note: we DON'T call next() — the request stops here
  }
  req.user = { id: 1, name: 'Ada' }; // in real life: verify the token
  next(); // authenticated — continue to the route
}

app.use(express.json());
app.use(requireAuth);

app.get('/tasks', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ owner: req.user.name, tasks: [] }); // req.user came from the middleware
});
```

*What just happened:* no header means an unauthenticated request, so `requireAuth` responds `401` and
**stops** — note there's no `next()` after it. A header sets `req.user` and calls `next()`, so by the
time `/tasks` runs, `req.user` is populated and the route trusts that auth already happened upstream.
Two halves of the pattern: **reject and stop**, or **enrich `req` and continue**. The `return` matters
— without it, the code would respond *and* fall through to `next()`, trying to send two responses.

## Recap

- **Middleware is a `(req, res, next)` function in a chain.** It can read/modify `req`/`res`, end the
  response, or call `next()`. Routes are middleware bound to a method and path.
- Register at three scopes: **global** (`app.use(fn)`), **path-scoped** (`app.use('/admin', fn)`), or
  **per-route** (`app.get(path, mw, handler)`).
- **Order matters.** Middleware runs top to bottom. `express.json()` must come before any route that
  reads `req.body`.
- A middleware that neither responds nor calls `next()` **hangs the request** — the #1 beginner bug.
- Use built-ins (`express.json`, `express.urlencoded`, `express.static`) and third-party packages
  (`cors`, `morgan`, `helmet`) instead of writing your own.
- Share work down the chain by **attaching to `req`** (e.g. an auth middleware sets `req.user`); reject
  with `res.status(401)` and *don't* call `next()`.

    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "Middleware runs in registration order. If express.json() is registered after the route, the route runs first and req.body is undefined."
  },
  {
    "q": "A middleware logs a message but never calls next() and never sends a response. What is the result?",
    "choices": ["The next middleware runs anyway", "Express sends an automatic 404", "The request hangs until it times out", "The response is sent with status 200"],
    "answer": 2,
    "explain": "Every middleware must either respond or call next(). Doing neither leaves the request with nowhere to go, so it hangs — the most common beginner bug."
