# Error Handling

Here's the reframe that makes this whole phase click, so hold it before you write a single line of error code:

> 📝 In Fastify, **error handling is mostly something you DON'T do**. A request that fails your route schema is rejected for you with a `400`. An error thrown inside an `async` handler is caught for you and routed to one place. Your job isn't to wrap everything in `try/catch` — it's to **throw the right error** and then **decide, in one spot, how errors become responses**. The framework does the catching; you do the shaping.

If you came from [Express](/guides/express-from-zero), this is a genuine relief. There, an unhandled throw in an async route handler in Express 4 silently hangs the request unless you wired up `express-async-errors` or hand-passed errors to `next(err)`. Fastify removes that whole category of bug. We'll keep growing the same **books API**.

## The wins you already have for free

Before customizing anything, take inventory of what Fastify already does. Two big ones.

**Schema validation rejects bad input for you (a 400, no code).** You saw this back in [Routing & Schemas](02-routing-and-schemas.md): a body that violates the route's `body` schema never reaches your handler. Fastify short-circuits with a `400` and a structured message.

```javascript
// POST /books  with body  { "author": "Herbert" }   (no title)
//
// Fastify replies BEFORE your handler runs:
// 400 Bad Request
// {
//   "statusCode": 400,
//   "error": "Bad Request",
//   "message": "body must have required property 'title'"
// }
```

*What just happened:* Nothing of yours executed. The schema said `title` is required, the body lacked it, and Fastify produced a 400 with a clear message on its own. That's error handling you didn't write and don't maintain — the cheapest kind.

**Async throws are caught automatically.** In an `async` handler, you can just `throw`, and Fastify catches it and turns it into a response. Compare the two worlds:

```javascript
// Express 4: this throw is NOT caught — the request hangs.
app.get('/books/:id', async (req, res) => {
  const book = await db.find(req.params.id);
  if (!book) throw new Error('not found'); // request stalls; needs next(err) or a wrapper
  res.json(book);
});

// Fastify: this throw IS caught — it flows to the error handler.
app.get('/books/:id', async (request) => {
  const book = await db.find(request.params.id);
  if (!book) throw new Error('not found'); // caught for you → goes to setErrorHandler
  return book;
});
```

*What just happened:* Same logic, different safety net. Fastify wraps your async handler so a thrown error becomes a forwarded error rather than a hung socket. That's why, in Fastify, **throwing is the idiomatic way to bail out** of a handler — you don't need `try/catch` around your own logic just to send an error response.

## Shaping errors with `setErrorHandler`

Everything that gets thrown or forwarded — your throws, downstream plugin errors, validation failures — funnels into one function you can define: `setErrorHandler`. This is where you decide what an error *looks like* to the client.

```javascript
app.setErrorHandler((error, request, reply) => {
  request.log.error(error);
  const status = error.statusCode || 500;
  reply.code(status).send({ error: error.message || 'Internal Server Error' });
});
```

*What just happened:* Every error that reaches Fastify now passes through here. We log it with the request-scoped logger (so the log line carries the request id — handy in production), read a `statusCode` off the error if it has one (defaulting to `500`), and send a small, consistent body. From now on, every error response in the app has the same shape. That consistency is the entire point — clients shouldn't have to guess whether an error is `{ error }` or `{ message }` or `{ msg }` depending on which route blew up.

Notice the lever that makes this work: **`error.statusCode`**. Fastify reads it to set the HTTP status. So the way you control *which* status a thrown error produces is by putting a `statusCode` on the error before you throw it:

```javascript
app.get('/books/:id', async (request) => {
  const id = Number(request.params.id);
  const book = books.find((b) => b.id === id);
  if (!book) {
    const err = new Error('Book not found');
    err.statusCode = 404;
    throw err;
  }
  return book;
});
```

*What just happened:* We built a plain `Error`, tagged it with `statusCode = 404`, and threw it. Fastify caught it, ran it through `setErrorHandler`, which read `error.statusCode` and replied `404 { "error": "Book not found" }`. No `reply.code(404)` scattered in the handler — the handler just states "this is a 404 situation" and the central handler renders it.

## Typed errors without the boilerplate: `@fastify/sensible`

Hand-stamping `err.statusCode = 404` on every error gets old. The official `@fastify/sensible` plugin gives you a set of ready-made HTTP error throwers under `app.httpErrors`, so you don't construct errors by hand.

```javascript
import sensible from '@fastify/sensible';

await app.register(sensible);

app.get('/books/:id', async (request) => {
  const id = Number(request.params.id);
  const book = books.find((b) => b.id === id);
  if (!book) throw app.httpErrors.notFound('Book not found'); // a 404, fully formed
  return book;
});
```

*What just happened:* `app.httpErrors.notFound('Book not found')` returns an error object that already carries `statusCode: 404` and the right message, so throwing it produces a clean 404. There are throwers for the whole family — `badRequest`, `unauthorized`, `forbidden`, `conflict`, `unprocessableEntity`, and so on. It reads like the intent (`throw app.httpErrors.conflict('that ISBN already exists')`) instead of error plumbing.

> 💡 This is the rhythm to internalize: **throw typed errors from your handlers, let schema validation throw for you on bad input, and let one `setErrorHandler` render all of it.** Your handlers stay focused on the happy path and `throw` to bail; the shape of every error response lives in exactly one place.

## The 404 for unknown routes: `setNotFoundHandler`

There's one error the error handler does *not* catch by default: a request to a route that doesn't exist at all (say `DELETE /widgets` when you have no widgets route). That's not a thrown error — there's no handler to run. Fastify replies with its own default 404. To make that 404 match the rest of your API, set a not-found handler:

```javascript
app.setNotFoundHandler((request, reply) => {
  reply.code(404).send({ error: 'Not Found' });
});
```

*What just happened:* Now an unmatched URL returns *your* `{ "error": "Not Found" }` body with a 404, consistent with what `setErrorHandler` produces for thrown errors. Two different doors (no-such-route vs. error-while-handling), but the client sees one consistent house style.

## Reshaping validation errors

By default a schema-validation failure produces `{ statusCode, error, message }`. That's fine for most APIs, but sometimes you want your own envelope — say, a `fields` array a frontend can map to form inputs. You don't disable validation to do this; you reshape it *inside* `setErrorHandler` by checking `error.validation`.

When Fastify rejects a request for schema reasons, the error it forwards carries a `validation` property: an array of the individual schema violations. Branch on it:

```javascript
app.setErrorHandler((error, request, reply) => {
  if (error.validation) {
    // schema-validation failure → return our own shape
    return reply.code(400).send({
      error: 'Validation failed',
      fields: error.validation.map((v) => v.instancePath || v.params.missingProperty)
    });
  }
  // everything else → the generic path
  request.log.error(error);
  const status = error.statusCode || 500;
  reply.code(status).send({ error: error.message || 'Internal Server Error' });
});
```

*What just happened:* The same central handler now has two branches. When `error.validation` is present, we know this came from schema validation and we emit our custom `{ error, fields }` shape with a 400. Everything else falls through to the generic logging-and-status path from before. Validation still runs automatically and still rejects bad input before your handler — we only changed how that rejection is *presented*.

> ⚠️ `error.validation` exists **only** on errors that come from schema validation. Don't read `error.validation.map(...)` unconditionally — on a regular thrown error it's `undefined` and you'll crash your own error handler (the one place you really don't want to throw). Always gate it behind the `if (error.validation)` check, as above.

## Recap

- Most error handling in Fastify is **automatic**: schema validation rejects bad input with a `400` you didn't write, and `async` throws are caught for you (unlike bare Express 4) and forwarded.
- **Throwing is the idiomatic way to bail** out of a handler — no `try/catch` needed just to send an error response.
- `setErrorHandler` is the **one place** all thrown/forwarded errors become responses; it reads `error.statusCode` to set the HTTP status, so give your errors a `statusCode`.
- `@fastify/sensible` gives you `app.httpErrors.notFound(...)` and friends — typed errors with the right `statusCode` baked in, no hand-stamping.
- `setNotFoundHandler` customizes the 404 for **unmatched routes** (a separate door from `setErrorHandler`); reshape **validation** responses by checking `error.validation` inside `setErrorHandler`.
