# Templates & the MTV Pattern

Back in Phase 2 your views already started rendering templates instead of returning hand-typed HTML strings. This phase is where we slow down and look at the **T** in MTV properly — because that letter is doing more work than it looks like.

Here's the mental model to hold onto before any code: **a view's job is to gather data and hand it off; a template's job is to turn that data into HTML.** The view talks to the Model (your `Post` objects), bundles up what it found, and passes it to a Template that knows how to lay it out. The view never builds HTML; the template never touches the database. Keeping those jobs separate is why the same `Post` list can be rendered as a web page today and (Phase 9) as JSON tomorrow without rewriting your data logic.

📝 **MTV is Django's name for the same idea most people call MVC.** Model = your data (the ORM). Template = the presentation (HTML). View = the glue in the middle that decides *which* data goes to *which* template. The flow for one request is short and always the same: **request → URLconf picks a view → view queries the Model → view calls `render()` with a template + data → HTML goes back to the browser.**

## Where templates fit

A view renders a template with `render()`. You give it three things: the request, the path to a template, and a dict of data:

```python
# blog/views.py
from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import Post

def post_list(request):
    posts = Post.objects.all()
    return render(request, "blog/post_list.html", {"posts": posts})
```

*What just happened:* the view fetched every `Post` from the database (Model), then handed that list to `render()` along with a template path and a dict. `render()` finds `blog/post_list.html`, runs it with `posts` available inside, and returns a finished `HttpResponse` full of HTML. The view itself contains zero HTML — it only decides *what* to show, not *how* it looks.

📝 That template path — `"blog/post_list.html"` — lives in a `templates/` folder inside your app: `blog/templates/blog/post_list.html`. The doubled `blog/` is deliberate: Django searches *all* apps' `templates/` folders as one merged pile, so the inner `blog/` namespaces your files and stops your `post_list.html` from colliding with some other app's `post_list.html`.

## The Django Template Language

A template is mostly plain HTML with three special markers sprinkled in. That's the entire language, and there are only three shapes to learn:

- `{{ variable }}` — **output** a value. `{{ post.title }}` prints the title.
- `{% tag %}` — **logic**: loops, conditionals, and helpers like `{% for %}`, `{% if %}`, `{% url %}`.
- `{{ value|filter }}` — **transform** a value on its way out: `{{ post.body|truncatewords:30 }}`.

Here's `post_list.html` looping over the posts the view passed in:

```html
<h1>The Blog</h1>

{% for post in posts %}
  <article>
    <h2><a href="{% url 'post_detail' post.id %}">{{ post.title }}</a></h2>
    <p class="meta">{{ post.published_at|date:"M j, Y" }}</p>
    <p>{{ post.body|truncatewords:30 }}</p>
  </article>
{% empty %}
  <p>No posts yet. {{ empty_message|default:"Check back soon." }}</p>
{% endfor %}
```

*What just happened:* `{% for post in posts %}` walks the list. For each post, `{{ post.title }}` prints the title and `{% url 'post_detail' post.id %}` builds the link by *name* (the named routes from Phase 2's URLconf) instead of hardcoding a path — so if the URL pattern ever changes, this link follows it automatically. The filters earn their keep too: `|date:"M j, Y"` formats a datetime into `Jun 22, 2026`, and `|truncatewords:30` clips the body to 30 words. The `{% empty %}` branch runs only when `posts` is empty, and `|default:` supplies a fallback if `empty_message` is missing or falsy.

⚠️ The Django Template Language is **deliberately limited** — you cannot call arbitrary Python, do math, or run a database query from inside a template. That's a feature, not a missing one: real logic belongs in the **view**, where it's testable and visible. If you find yourself fighting the template to compute something, that's the template telling you the work should have happened in the view first.

## Context: what the template can see

That dict you pass to `render()` has a name: the **context**. It's the *entire* world the template can see. If a name isn't in the context, the template does not have it at all — there's no reaching back into the view or the database for more.

```python
# blog/views.py
def post_list(request):
    posts = Post.objects.all()
    context = {
        "posts": posts,
        "show_drafts": request.user.is_staff,
    }
    return render(request, "blog/post_list.html", context)
```

*What just happened:* the view built a context with two keys and handed it over. Inside the template, `{{ posts }}` and `{{ show_drafts }}` are now available — and *nothing else from the view is*. Rename the key and the template's `{{ posts }}` goes blank. That tight boundary is what makes templates predictable: to know what a template can use, you only have to read the context, not the whole view.

💡 You can drive logic off context values: `{% if show_drafts %}...{% endif %}` shows a block only to staff. The decision (`request.user.is_staff`) was made in the view; the template just reacts to the boolean it was given. View decides, template displays.

## Template inheritance: write the layout once

Every page on your site shares chrome — the same `<head>`, nav bar, and footer. Copy-pasting that into every template is how you end up updating the nav in eleven files and missing one. Django's answer is **template inheritance**: a `base.html` defines the skeleton with `{% block %}` holes, and child templates fill the holes.

```html
<!-- blog/templates/blog/base.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>{% block title %}The Blog{% endblock %}</title>
</head>
<body>
  <nav><a href="/">Home</a></nav>

  <main>
    {% block content %}{% endblock %}
  </main>

  <footer>Built with Django</footer>
</body>
</html>
```

```html
<!-- blog/templates/blog/post_list.html -->
{% extends "blog/base.html" %}

{% block title %}All Posts — The Blog{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
  <h1>The Blog</h1>
  {% for post in posts %}
    <h2>{{ post.title }}</h2>
  {% endfor %}
{% endblock %}
```

*What just happened:* `base.html` lays out the page once and marks two spots — `{% block title %}` and `{% block content %}` — as overridable. The child template's `{% extends "blog/base.html" %}` says "start from that skeleton," then its own `{% block %}` tags pour content into the matching holes. The child never repeats the `<nav>`, the `<footer>`, or the `<head>`. Change the footer in `base.html` and every page that extends it updates at once — the **DRY** win for server-rendered HTML.

## Auto-escaping: the XSS shield you didn't ask for

Now the part that quietly protects you. By default, **Django templates auto-escape every variable they output.** If a `{{ post.body }}` contains `<script>alert('xss')</script>`, Django doesn't render a live script tag — it converts the angle brackets to `&lt;script&gt;` so the browser prints the text harmlessly instead of executing it.

```console
Stored post body:  Nice post! <script>steal()</script>
Rendered to page:  Nice post! &lt;script&gt;steal()&lt;/script&gt;
```

*What just happened:* a malicious comment body went *into* the template, but auto-escaping defanged it on the way *out*. The user sees the literal text; the browser never runs the script. This is your default defense against **cross-site scripting (XSS)** — the attack where someone smuggles markup through user input to run code in another visitor's browser. Same family of trust-the-input mistake as SQL injection; for the full picture, read [SQL Injection & XSS](/guides/sql-injection-and-xss). In Django templates, the safe behavior is the one you get for free.

⚠️ The escape hatch is `|safe` (or `mark_safe()` in Python), which tells Django "trust this, render it raw" — turning the shield **off** for that value. Only reach for it on content *you* generated or have sanitized, never on anything a user typed. `{{ comment.body|safe }}` on a user-submitted comment is exactly how an XSS hole gets created.

💡 You'll also start seeing `{% csrf_token %}` the moment you add a form — it drops a hidden token into the HTML that proves a form submission really came from your own page, and earns its full explanation next phase.

💡 Templates are the **V**iew the user actually sees — the rendered surface of your app. So far the data has flowed one direction: database → view → template → browser. Next we reverse it: **forms** are how data flows back *in*, from the user to your app, and that's exactly where `{% csrf_token %}` and validation come in.

## Recap

- **MTV** splits work cleanly: the **Model** holds data, the **View** gathers it and decides what to show, the **Template** turns it into HTML. The view never builds HTML; the template never queries the database.
- A view renders with `render(request, "blog/post_list.html", {"posts": posts})` — request, template path, and a **context** dict of data.
- The **template language** has three shapes: `{{ variable }}` to output, `{% tag %}` for logic (`{% for %}`, `{% if %}`, `{% url %}`), and `{{ value|filter }}` to transform. It's deliberately limited — real logic stays in the view.
- The **context** is the template's entire world. Only the names you put in the dict are visible inside.
- **Template inheritance** (`{% block %}` in `base.html`, `{% extends %}` in children) gives you shared layout with zero duplication — the DRY win for server-rendered HTML.
- Django **auto-escapes** variables by default, blocking XSS for free. `|safe`/`mark_safe` turns that off — only use it on content you trust, never on user input.

    "choices": ["The Template", "The View", "The URLconf"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "The View gathers data from the Model and hands it to the Template via render(). The template only displays what it's given."

    "choices": ["Django reaches back into the view to find author", "author is empty — only names in the context dict are visible", "It raises a hard error and the page 500s"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "The context is the template's entire world. A name not in the dict renders as empty; the template can't reach outside it."
  },
  {
    "q": "A comment body contains <script>steal()</script>. You render it with {{ comment.body }}. What does the visitor's browser do?",
    "choices": ["Runs the script — XSS succeeds", "Prints the text harmlessly because Django auto-escapes it", "Strips the tag silently and shows nothing"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "Auto-escaping converts the angle brackets to entities, so the browser prints the literal text instead of executing it. Adding |safe would disable this and reopen the XSS hole."
