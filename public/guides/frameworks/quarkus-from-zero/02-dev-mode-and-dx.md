# Dev Mode & the Developer Experience

Phase 1 built the mental model: Quarkus moves work from runtime to build time, which is why it boots in milliseconds. That same machinery has a second payoff you *feel* every day, and it's the reason most people who try Quarkus don't want to go back: the inner loop of edit-code-see-result, run hundreds of times a day.

The mental model for this phase: **Quarkus treats your running dev server as a live thing you talk to, not a build you keep restarting.** Java has a long reputation for the "change one line, wait thirty seconds" tax. Quarkus's dev experience is an attack on that tax - you start the app once and stay in flow, without ever stopping and starting it yourself.

Four pieces make that real: live reload, the Dev UI, continuous testing, and Dev Services.

## `quarkus dev` and live reload

```bash
quarkus dev
```

*What just happened:* you started Quarkus in **dev mode**. The app comes up on `http://localhost:8080` and is now *watching your source files* - dev mode is a first-class run mode of Quarkus itself, not a separate tool. (Maven: `./mvnw quarkus:dev`; Gradle: `./gradlew quarkusDev` - same behavior.)

> 📝 **Live reload happens on the *next request*, not on save.** Quarkus doesn't rebuild in the background when you change a file. It waits until the next time you hit the app - a refresh, a `curl`, an API call - and *then* recompiles and reloads the changed code before serving that request. The first request after an edit pays a tiny recompile cost; everything after is instant.

Nothing recompiles while you're still typing - the work happens exactly when you ask to *see* a result.

Say you have a resource that returns a greeting:

```java
package org.acme;

import jakarta.ws.rs.GET;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Path;

@Path("/products")
public class ProductResource {

    @GET
    public String list() {
        return "Product list coming soon";
    }
}
```

With `quarkus dev` running, hit it:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/products
```

```console
Product list coming soon
```

Now change the returned text to `"We have 3 products"` and **save**. Don't restart anything - run the same `curl` again:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/products
```

```console
We have 3 products
```

*What just happened:* between the two requests you changed Java source and never touched the server. On the second request Quarkus noticed the file was newer, recompiled `ProductResource`, and served the response - transparently. Edit, refresh, see it.

> 💡 This covers most config and dependency changes too - a new endpoint method, a tweaked `application.properties`, a new extension all get picked up on the next request. Cases needing a full restart (deep classpath surgery) are rare enough you'll forget restarting was ever a habit.

## The Dev UI: a console for your running app

Live reload keeps you in flow; the **Dev UI** lets you see inside the app while it runs:

```bash
http://localhost:8080/q/dev
```

> 📝 The **Dev UI** is a web console Quarkus serves *only in dev mode* - a live dashboard of every **extension**, your current **configuration**, the **CDI beans** wired up, your **REST endpoints**, plus interactive tools to poke at them. It ships with the dev-mode runtime and disappears in production.

What you'll actually use:

- **Extensions** - a card for each one (REST, Hibernate, a database driver...), often with its own views.
- **Configuration** - every property and its current value, editable live.
- **Beans / CDI** - the full list of beans and how they're scoped. When [CDI in Phase 4](04-cdi-with-arc.md) makes you wonder "did my bean get registered?", look here.
- **Endpoints** - every route, often invokable straight from the browser. No Postman needed.

*What just happened:* the same build-time metadata that makes Quarkus fast - the catalog of beans, routes, and config - gets handed to a UI you can browse. When something behaves oddly, "open `/q/dev` and look" is often faster than reading code.

## Continuous testing: red/green without leaving the terminal

Look at the terminal where `quarkus dev` is running - there's an interactive prompt at the bottom. Press `r`:

```console
Tests paused
Press [r] to resume, [h] for more options>
r
--
Running 1/1. Running: ProductResourceTest#listReturnsProducts()
All 1 tests are passing (0 failed), 1 tests were run in 412ms.
Press [r] to re-run, [o] Toggle test output, [h] for more options>
```

*What just happened:* you turned on **continuous testing**. From now on, every code change re-runs the affected tests automatically - only the tests touched by the change, not the whole suite - and you get a green or red result right in the terminal, seconds after you save.

`r` re-runs, `o` toggles test output, `h` shows the full menu.

> 💡 Change the `Product` resource, glance at the terminal, watch its test go red or green - you're getting TDD-style feedback whether or not you set out to "do TDD." (Deeper in [Phase 8](08-testing.md).)

## Dev Services: zero-config infrastructure

Suppose your `Product` service needs a real database. Add the Postgres extension and *don't* configure a connection at all. You'd expect it to fail on startup:

```console
INFO  Dev Services for default datasource (postgresql) started
INFO  Container postgres:16 is starting...
INFO  Profile dev activated. Live Coding activated.
INFO  Installed features: [cdi, hibernate-orm, jdbc-postgresql, rest, smallrye-context-propagation]
```

*What just happened:* Quarkus noticed the Postgres extension but **no datasource configured**, and instead of erroring, spun up a throwaway PostgreSQL **in a container** and wired your app to it automatically - **Dev Services**. Zero connection strings, no database installed, yet a real Postgres. Stop dev mode and the container goes away.

Same for MySQL, MariaDB, Kafka, Redis, MongoDB, and more: add the extension, leave it unconfigured in dev.

> 📝 The rule: **if** an extension needs a service **and** you haven't configured one for this profile, **then** start a throwaway one. The moment you *do* set a connection, Dev Services backs off. Your config always wins.

⚠️ This needs a container runtime - Dev Services starts containers via Testcontainers, so you need **Docker or Podman running**. No runtime, no auto-database. This is a **dev and test** convenience only - production needs real configured connections. See [Docker Without the Magic](/guides/docker-without-the-magic) if containers are new.

> 💡 What just got deleted from your life: the "set up your local environment" wiki page. Clone, `quarkus dev`, and a clean database is waiting.

## Why developer experience actually matters

> 💡 **Fast feedback is a force multiplier.** The length of your inner loop silently sets the ceiling on how fast you can think. A thirty-second rebuild costs your concentration, not just thirty seconds - you context-switch while you wait. Shrink the loop to near-zero and you stay *in* the problem, try more ideas, and catch mistakes while the change is still fresh.

Phase 1's pitch was about *production*: fast startup, low memory, cheap at scale. This phase's pitch is about *you*, every day at your desk - a language famous for slow rebuilds, made to feel instant.

Next we write real REST endpoints for the `Product` service - and feel live reload as we go.

## Recap

- **`quarkus dev` starts dev mode**, which watches your source and keeps the app running so you never manually restart during development.
- **Live reload recompiles on the *next request*, not on save** — the first request after an edit pays a tiny recompile cost; the result is "edit, refresh, see it" with no restart.
- **The Dev UI (`/q/dev`)** is a dev-only web console showing your extensions, config, beans, and endpoints, with tools to poke at them — the app's internal model made visible.
- **Continuous testing** (press `r` in the dev console) re-runs the affected tests automatically on every change, giving red/green feedback in the terminal and nudging you toward a TDD-style flow.
- **Dev Services** auto-starts throwaway containers (Postgres, Kafka, Redis…) when an extension needs a service you haven't configured — zero-config local infra. It needs a container runtime (Docker/Podman) and is **dev/test only**; your own config always wins.
- **Fast feedback is the real point.** A near-instant inner loop keeps you in flow and is a genuine reason teams choose Quarkus, separate from its runtime speed.
