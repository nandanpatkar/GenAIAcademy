# Results & State

Here's the mental model before anything else: **the broker and the result backend are two different mailboxes.** In Phase 3 we kept saying `.delay()` hands you back an `AsyncResult` — a receipt. That receipt is only useful if there's somewhere for the worker to *write down* what happened. The broker carries the message *to* the worker; it does not carry the answer back. For that you need a second store, the **result backend**, where the worker records "this task finished, here's its return value" or "this task blew up, here's the error."

Once that clicks, the rest of this phase is just: how do I set up that second mailbox, how do I read from it, and — the part most people get wrong — do I even need it?

## The result backend

📝 To capture what a task returned (or even just whether it succeeded), Celery needs a **result backend**: a place to store outcomes, keyed by task id. Configured separately from the broker, it can be Redis, a SQL database, or a few other stores.

```python
# celery_app.py
from celery import Celery

app = Celery(
    "myapp",
    broker="redis://localhost:6379/0",     # where messages go OUT
    backend="redis://localhost:6379/1",    # where results come BACK
)
```

*What just happened:* we pointed `broker` and `backend` at the same Redis server but **different databases** (`/0` vs `/1`) — separate concerns, kept in separate stores even on the same box. The broker holds pending *work*; the backend holds finished *outcomes*. They happen to both be Redis here, which is common, but don't have to be — plenty of setups use Redis as broker and Postgres as backend.

⚠️ Without a backend configured, results are **discarded**. The task still runs perfectly fine — the email still sends — but `result.get()` will hang or error, and `result.status` can never move past `PENDING`, because there's nowhere for the worker to write the outcome. If you can't read a result, first check whether you set `backend=` at all.

## AsyncResult: your handle on a running task

📝 When you call `.delay()` (or `.apply_async()`), you get back an `AsyncResult` — a thin handle to one specific task, identified by its id. It doesn't *contain* the result; it knows how to go *ask the backend* about it. The pieces you'll use:

- `result.id` — the unique task id (a UUID string). Save this if you want to check back later.
- `result.ready()` — `True` if the task has finished (success or failure), `False` if still pending/running.
- `result.status` — the current state, e.g. `"PENDING"`, `"SUCCESS"`, `"FAILURE"`.
- `result.get(timeout=...)` — fetch the actual return value, **blocking** until it's ready (or the timeout expires).

```python
# enqueue and hold onto the receipt
result = generate_report.delay(account_id, "2026-06")

print(result.id)        # "d5b8...e91" — a handle you could store and reload
print(result.ready())   # False — the worker probably hasn't finished yet
print(result.status)    # "PENDING"

# later, when you actually need the answer:
report_path = result.get(timeout=30)   # blocks up to 30s, then returns the value
```

*What just happened:* `.delay()` returned instantly with a receipt. `ready()` and `status` are cheap, non-blocking peeks at the backend — they answer "is it done yet?" without waiting. `get()` is the opposite: it **sits and waits** for the worker to finish, then hands you whatever the task `return`ed. `timeout=30` is a safety valve so you're not blocked forever if the worker is wedged.

⚠️ `get()` **blocks the calling thread until the task completes.** That's fine in a one-off script or the shell. It's a trap inside a web request — you'd hand control to Celery only to immediately sit and wait for it, throwing away the entire point of going async.

⚠️ Worse: **never call `.get()` inside another task.** A worker blocking on another task's result can deadlock the whole pool — if all your workers are busy waiting on results that only a free worker could produce, nothing moves. If you need to chain work, that's what chains and workflows are for, not nested `get()` calls.

## Task states

📝 A task moves through a small set of states, and the backend records the latest one:

- **PENDING** — Celery doesn't know anything yet. Queued but not started, *or* an id it's never heard of (more on that below).
- **STARTED** — a worker has picked it up and begun (only tracked if you opt in via `task_track_started`).
- **SUCCESS** — finished cleanly; the return value is in the backend.
- **FAILURE** — raised an exception; the backend holds the traceback.
- **RETRY** — failed but is scheduled to run again (Phase 5).
- **REVOKED** — cancelled before it could run.

```python
result = send_welcome_email.delay(user.id)

result.status        # "PENDING"  — just enqueued
# ...worker picks it up and runs...
result.status        # "SUCCESS"
result.successful()  # True
result.failed()      # False
```

*What just happened:* we watched one task walk from `PENDING` to `SUCCESS`. The convenience methods `successful()` / `failed()` are just readable wrappers over `status`. The flow is always: unknown/queued → (started) → a terminal state (`SUCCESS`, `FAILURE`, or `REVOKED`), possibly looping through `RETRY` on the way.

⚠️ Here's the confusion that bites everyone: **PENDING also means "I have no record of this id."** Celery's backend stores a result *after* a task reaches a terminal state — it does **not** write a row the moment you enqueue. So Celery genuinely cannot tell "queued, waiting for a worker" apart from "this id never existed / was a typo." Both report `PENDING`. If a result is stuck `PENDING` forever, don't assume it's still running — it may have finished and expired, or you may be checking an id the backend never saw.

## When you need results — and when you don't

💡 The honest default for a lot of background work is: **you don't need the result.** `send_welcome_email` is fire-and-forget — nobody is waiting on its return value, and "did the email send?" is answered by your email provider's logs, not by polling Celery. Storing a result for it is pure overhead: every finished task writes a row to the backend nobody will ever read.

📝 You can turn results off per-task or globally:

```python
@app.task(ignore_result=True)
def send_welcome_email(user_id):
    user = User.objects.get(id=user_id)
    send_email(to=user.email, subject="Welcome aboard!", body=render_welcome(user))

# or globally, in config:
# app.conf.task_ignore_result = True
```

*What just happened:* `ignore_result=True` tells Celery not to bother writing this task's outcome to the backend. The task runs identically; we've only stopped recording an answer no one asked for — a real saving in backend writes and storage for a busy email queue.

💡 You **do** need results when something downstream waits on the outcome: a user clicked "Download report" and the file path comes back from `generate_report`; or one step feeds the next in a chain. The rule of thumb: **keep a result only if a real reader exists.** Don't store results you'll never read — they're not free.

## Polling vs pushing

So a user kicks off `generate_report` and wants to know when it's ready. You already know not to block the request with `get()`. What do you do instead?

💡 The simple, robust pattern is **polling by id**:

1. The request enqueues the task and immediately returns `result.id` to the client.
2. The client (or a status endpoint) checks back periodically: "is task `d5b8…` done?"
3. When the status flips to `SUCCESS`, fetch the value and show the download link.

```python
# views.py
def start_report(request):
    result = generate_report.delay(request.user.account_id, "2026-06")
    return json({"task_id": result.id})          # return the receipt, don't wait

def report_status(request, task_id):
    result = generate_report.AsyncResult(task_id)  # rebuild the handle from the id
    if result.ready():
        return json({"state": result.status, "url": result.result})
    return json({"state": result.status})          # still PENDING/STARTED
```

*What just happened:* `start_report` returns instantly with just the id — the request is never blocked. `report_status` reconstructs an `AsyncResult` **from that id alone** (no new task is enqueued; we're just looking one up) and reports whether it's done. The client polls this second endpoint every couple of seconds. Nobody blocks; the worker churns away independently. For richer experiences you can skip polling entirely and **push** completion — a websocket message or a webhook the task fires on success.

⚠️ One last gotcha: **results expire.** Celery deletes them from the backend after `result_expires` (24 hours by default), so a result is a short-lived notification, not durable storage. If a user might come back next week for that report, persist the real outcome (the file, a DB row) yourself. And sometimes the status you poll won't be `SUCCESS` but `FAILURE` or `RETRY` — handling *that* gracefully is exactly where Phase 5 picks up.

## Recap

- The **result backend** is a separate store from the broker — configure it with `backend=`. The broker carries work out; the backend carries outcomes back. Without one, results are discarded and status never leaves `PENDING`.
- `.delay()` returns an **`AsyncResult`**: a handle by id. Use `result.id`, `result.ready()`, `result.status` for cheap non-blocking peeks, and `result.get(timeout=...)` to fetch the return value.
- **`.get()` blocks.** Never call it inside a web request (defeats the purpose) or inside another task (can deadlock the worker pool).
- Task states run **PENDING → STARTED → SUCCESS / FAILURE / RETRY / REVOKED.** `PENDING` is ambiguous: it also means "unknown id," so don't read it as proof a task is still running.
- Skip results for fire-and-forget work (`ignore_result=True`); keep them only when a real reader waits. Expose a **status endpoint and poll by id** rather than blocking — and remember results **expire** (`result_expires`), so persist anything you need long-term yourself.

## Quick check

Check your grip on results and state before we get into failures:

```quiz
[
  {
    "q": "You configured Celery with only broker= and no backend=. A task runs fine, but result.status stays PENDING forever. Why?",
    "choices": [
      "The worker crashed silently",
      "With no result backend there is nowhere to record the outcome, so status can never advance",
      "PENDING means the task is still running"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "The backend is where outcomes get written. With no backend, results are discarded and status is stuck — the task still ran, you just can't observe its outcome."
  },
  {
    "q": "Why is calling result.get() inside a web request a mistake?",
    "choices": [
      "It returns the wrong value",
      "It blocks the request until the task finishes, throwing away the whole point of going async",
      "get() only works in the shell"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explain": ".get() blocks the caller until completion. In a request that means the user waits exactly as long as a synchronous call — return the task id and poll a status endpoint instead."
  },
  {
    "q": "A task is fire-and-forget (send_welcome_email) and nothing ever reads its return value. What's the sensible setup?",
    "choices": [
      "Set ignore_result=True so Celery doesn't store an outcome nobody reads",
      "Always store the result so you have a record",
      "Call .get() after .delay() to confirm it sent"
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explain": "Storing results you'll never read is pure overhead that piles up in the backend. ignore_result=True skips the write; the task runs identically."
  }
]
