# Keeping CI Trustworthy

CI only works if people believe it. A green check is a promise - "this code is safe to merge" - and the
entire value of CI rests on that promise being true. The fastest way to destroy a CI setup isn't a broken
server or a bad config. It's something quieter and far more corrosive: tests that lie. Once the team
stops trusting red, you've lost the gate, with no warning.

## The cheat-card: red check, calm response

When a check goes red, work down this list before assuming you broke something:

| Symptom | Likely cause | Calm first move |
|---|---|---|
| Red in CI, green locally | Something on your machine isn't in the repo | Check for uncommitted files / undeclared deps (see [Phase 1](01-what-ci-testing-actually-is.md)) |
| Red on *install*, before tests run | Dependency / lockfile problem, not a test | Read the log - fix the environment, not the test |
| Red on one matrix cell only | OS- or version-specific bug | Reproduce on *that* version/OS |
| **Passed, then re-ran and passed** (was red) | **Flaky test** | Don't shrug - quarantine and fix it (below) |
| Red on a clear assertion failure | A real bug your test caught | Read expected vs. actual; fix the code |

The dangerous row is the flaky one. Let's give it the attention it deserves.

## ⚠️ Flaky tests: the thing that kills CI

**What it actually is.** A *flaky test* is a test that **passes or fails randomly on the exact same
code.** You change nothing, re-run the build, and the result flips. It's not testing your code anymore -
it's flipping a coin.

📝 **Terminology.** "Flaky" is the standard industry word for *non-deterministic* test results: the same
input doesn't always give the same output. A reliable test is *deterministic* - same code, same result,
every time.

**Why this is so much worse than a normal failure.** A real failure is honest: it tells you something is
broken, you fix it, it goes green. A flaky failure teaches the team a poison lesson - *red doesn't
necessarily mean broken.* Once people learn that, here's what happens, every time:

```text
   Day 1:   Red build.  "Probably just flaky." → click re-run → green → merge.
   Day 30:  Red build.  "Just re-run it." → green → merge.  (Nobody reads it.)
   Day 90:  Red build that is a REAL bug.  → "just re-run it" → still red →
            "ugh, the CI is flaky again" → merge anyway → ships the bug.
```

That last line is the catastrophe: the flaky tests trained everyone to ignore red, so when red finally
*meant* something, nobody listened. **A flaky suite is worse than no suite** - no suite at least doesn't
lull you into false confidence.

💡 **Key point.** Flakiness doesn't cost you one test. It slowly costs you the team's trust in *every*
test. Treat a flaky test as a real bug - a bug in your test suite - not as background noise.

## Why tests go flaky

Flakiness almost always traces back to one of three sources. Knowing them lets you spot a flaky test by
its shape:

**1. Timing.** The test assumes something finished by now, when sometimes it hasn't.

```javascript
// Flaky: hopes the data loads within 100ms. On a busy CI machine, sometimes it doesn't.
await sleep(100);
expect(screen.getText()).toBe('Loaded');

// Reliable: waits for the actual condition, however long it takes.
await waitFor(() => expect(screen.getText()).toBe('Loaded'));
```

*What just happened:* The first version races the clock - a `sleep` is a guess, and a busy CI machine is
slower than your laptop, so the guess sometimes loses. The second waits for the *thing you actually care
about* instead of a fixed delay. **Fixed sleeps are the single most common source of flakiness.** Wait
for conditions, not for time.

**2. Test order / shared state.** A test passes alone but fails when run after another, because they
share something - a database row, a global variable, a file, a clock.

```text
   test A:  creates user "alice", does NOT clean up
   test B:  asserts "no users exist"   ← passes alone, FAILS after A

   Run order [A, B] → B fails.   Run order [B, A] → B passes.
   CI shuffles or parallelizes order → result flips → "flaky."
```

*What just happened:* Neither test is wrong in isolation, but they leak state into each other. The fix is
**isolation**: each test sets up and tears down its own data, assuming nothing about what ran before.

**3. External dependencies.** The test reaches out to a real network service, a live API, a real clock,
or randomness. Anything outside your control can hiccup, and your test fails for a reason that has
nothing to do with your code. The fix is to *control* those edges - fake the network, fix the clock,
seed the randomness - so the test only fails when *your* code is actually wrong.

⚠️ **Gotcha.** The instinct when a test flakes is to add a retry or a longer `sleep` and move on. That
doesn't fix flakiness - it *hides* it, makes the suite slower, and lets the underlying race survive to
bite again. A retry around a genuinely flaky test is sweeping the coin-flip under the rug.

## When you can't fix it right now: quarantine

Sometimes you find a flaky test and can't fix it this minute. The right move isn't to leave it failing
randomly (poisoning trust) or to delete it (losing coverage) - it's to **quarantine** it: mark it as
skipped, with a tracking ticket, so the build goes reliably green again while the flaky test waits to be
fixed.

```javascript
// Skip until fixed - keeps the build trustworthy without losing the test.
test.skip('reconnects after network drop - FLAKY, see issue #482', () => {
  // ...
});
```

*What just happened:* The test is temporarily removed from the gate, with a breadcrumb (`#482`) so it's
tracked, not forgotten. The build's green is honest again - quarantine is a holding cell, not a graveyard.

## Keeping the suite fast (so people run it)

A slow suite causes flakiness's cousin: people stop waiting for it. If CI takes 40 minutes, developers
merge before it finishes, context-switch away, and the feedback loop you built for safety becomes a
formality. Speed is a reliability feature.

The biggest lever is the **shape** of your suite - the test pyramid. Many fast, isolated unit tests at
the base; fewer integration tests in the middle; a handful of slow end-to-end tests at the top. A suite
that's mostly slow E2E tests is both *slow* and *flaky-prone* (E2E tests touch the most moving parts).
The pyramid keeps CI fast *and* reliable at once.

> ⏭️ The pyramid - what each layer tests and why the proportions matter - is its own topic. See
> [Unit, Integration & E2E](/guides/unit-integration-e2e) for the full picture. Here, the takeaway:
> **the pyramid is what keeps CI fast enough to trust.**

A few other practical levers, in rough order of payoff:

- **Run tests in parallel** across CPUs or machines - most runners support it.
- **Cache dependencies** between runs so `install` doesn't re-download the world every time.
- **Fix or quarantine flaky tests promptly** - a flaky suite wastes time on re-runs, which is its own
  slowness tax.

## Required checks: making the gate real

**What it actually is.** A *required status check* is a repository setting that says: *this check must be
green before the merge button is enabled.* It's what turns "we have CI" into "CI actually protects
`main`."

**Why you need it.** Without it, CI is advisory - a red check is just a suggestion someone can merge past.
With required checks, the platform refuses the merge until the gate is green. On GitHub this lives under
**branch protection rules** for `main`:

```text
   Branch protection on `main`:
     ☑ Require status checks to pass before merging
         └ required check:  CI / test
     ☑ Require branches to be up to date before merging
     ☑ Require a pull request before merging
```

*What just happened:* With these on, nobody - including admins, unless they explicitly override - can
merge into `main` until the `CI / test` check is green and the branch includes the latest `main`. The
gate is no longer a social norm you hope people honor; it's enforced by the platform for everyone.

📝 **Terminology.** **Branch protection** (GitHub's name; GitLab calls them *protected branches* with
*merge request approval rules*) is the set of rules guarding a branch - required checks, required
reviews, "must be up to date." Required *status checks* are the CI piece of that.

🪖 **War story.** A team added CI, felt safe, and kept shipping bugs to `main` for weeks - because the
checks ran but were never marked *required.* People glanced at red, judged it "probably flaky," and
merged anyway. The fix was one checkbox: make the check required. Suddenly red meant *blocked*, not
*ignorable*, and the bugs stopped reaching `main`. CI you can merge past isn't a gate; it's a decoration.

## Recap

1. CI's whole value is **trust in the green check** - protect it ruthlessly.
2. **Flaky tests** (pass/fail randomly on the same code) are the top threat: they teach the team that
   red is ignorable, so real failures get ignored too. A flaky suite is worse than no suite.
3. Flakiness comes from **timing** (fixed sleeps), **shared state / order**, and **external
   dependencies** - fix by waiting on conditions, isolating tests, and controlling the edges.
4. Can't fix now? **Quarantine** the test (skip + tracking ticket) so the build is honestly green.
5. Keep the suite **fast** - mostly via the test pyramid ([Unit, Integration & E2E](/guides/unit-integration-e2e)),
   plus parallelism and caching - so people actually wait for it.
6. **Required status checks / branch protection** make the gate real: the merge button stays blocked
   until CI is green. CI you can merge past is decoration, not protection.
