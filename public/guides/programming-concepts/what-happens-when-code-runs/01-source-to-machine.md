# From Source Code to Something the Machine Runs

Open one of your program files in a text editor. It's text - letters, numbers, brackets, indentation. You could print it on paper. Nothing about it physically *does* anything; it's a description, written for a human to read and a machine to be told about.

Here's the gap nobody points out: **the CPU - the chip actually doing the work - cannot read that text.** It has no idea what `print`, `if`, or `def` mean. The CPU understands one thing: a stream of extremely simple, numeric instructions ("add these two numbers," "copy this value here," "jump to that spot"). That's its entire vocabulary. So *something* has to stand between the words you wrote and the instructions the chip can run. This phase is about what that something is.

## What your code actually is, and what the machine actually runs

**What source code actually is.** Your `.py`, `.js`, `.go`, or `.c` file is **source code**: text written in a programming language, designed to be readable by people. It's the *source* - the original, human-friendly description of what you want to happen.

📝 **Terminology.** *Source code* = the human-readable text you write. *Machine code* = the raw numeric instructions a specific CPU can execute directly. They are two completely different things; one has to become the other before anything runs.

**What the machine runs.** The CPU runs **machine code**: a long sequence of tiny instructions, encoded as numbers, that match that exact kind of chip. Machine code is not readable in any practical sense - it's the opposite end of the spectrum from your source. Here's the contrast, made concrete:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Src["source code<br/>total = price + tax"] --> Trans["translate"]
  Trans --> M1["load price → reg A"]
  Trans --> M2["load tax → reg B"]
  Trans --> M3["add A, B → reg A"]
  Trans --> M4["store reg A → total"]
```

One readable line on the left can become several machine instructions on the right. The translation from one to the other is the job we're about to meet, and there are two ways to do it.

💡 **Key point.** Every program, in every language, has to cross this same gap: from human-readable source to machine-runnable instructions. The whole "compiled vs. interpreted" debate is just a debate about *when* and *how* that crossing happens.

## The two ways across the gap

There are two strategies for turning your source code into something that runs, easiest understood by analogy: imagine you wrote a book in English and need it read aloud to a French-speaking audience.

- **Strategy one: translate the whole book ahead of time.** A translator converts the entire book into French and prints it. Later, anyone can read the French copy aloud, fast, as many times as they like - the translation work is already done. This is **compiling**.
- **Strategy two: bring a live interpreter to the reading.** No French copy exists. As you read each English sentence, the interpreter speaks the French version on the spot. It works immediately, with no upfront print job - but the interpreter has to be present every time, translating as you go. This is **interpreting**.

Both get the story to the French audience. They just pay the translation cost at different moments.

## The compiler: translate-ahead

**What it actually is.** A **compiler** is a program that takes your *entire* source file and translates it, all at once, *before* the program ever runs, into machine code (or something close to it). The output is a separate, ready-to-run file - an **executable**.

📝 **Terminology.** A *compiler* translates whole source code into machine code ahead of time. An *executable* (a `.exe` on Windows, or a plain binary on macOS/Linux) is the resulting file of machine code you can run directly.

Languages that work this way include **Go, Rust, and C**.

**What it does in real life.** You run the compiler once. It chews through your code, reports any errors it finds, and - if all is well - hands you an executable. From then on, running your program means running *that file*; the compiler isn't involved.

```console
$ go build hello.go
$ ls
hello       hello.go
$ ./hello
Hello, world!
```
*What just happened:* `go build` was the compiler. It read your source file `hello.go` and produced a new file, `hello` - the executable, a bundle of machine code for your kind of computer. Running `./hello` ran *that file* directly on the CPU. The `.go` source wasn't consulted at all; the translation already happened during `go build`.

**The trade-off.** Because the translation is done up front, the program starts and runs fast - there's no translating while it runs. The cost is paid earlier: you have to compile before you can run (a step that takes time on big projects), and the executable is built for one kind of machine, so a binary compiled for Windows won't run on a Mac.

## The interpreter: translate-as-you-go

**What it actually is.** An **interpreter** is a program that reads your source code and runs it *directly*, working through it piece by piece, translating-and-executing as it goes. There's no separate executable produced ahead of time - the interpreter is doing the translation live, every time the program runs.

📝 **Terminology.** An *interpreter* reads and executes source code on the fly, a piece at a time, rather than translating the whole thing into a standalone executable first.

Languages commonly run this way include **Python and JavaScript**.

**What it does in real life.** Hand your source file straight to the interpreter and it starts running immediately - no build step.

```console
$ python hello.py
Hello, world!
```
*What just happened:* `python` is the interpreter. It read `hello.py` and ran it on the spot - figuring out what each line means and doing it, line by line, right then. Nothing was pre-translated into a separate machine-code file; the interpreter stayed in charge the whole time the program ran. That's why `python` has to be installed for the program to run at all.

**The trade-off.** You get to run code instantly - edit, run, edit, run, with no waiting on a build. That fast feedback loop is a real pleasure. The cost is that the translating happens *while the program runs*, over and over, so the same work tends to run slower than the compiled version, where translation was done once, in advance.

⚠️ **Gotcha - "compiled" and "interpreted" describe how a language is *usually run*, not a law of nature.** The same language can often be run either way, and many modern languages blur the line (some interpreters compile hot code to machine instructions while running, a technique called just-in-time compilation). So when someone says "Python is interpreted," hear it as "Python is normally run by an interpreter," not "Python can only ever be interpreted." Don't over-trust the label.

## The honest comparison

Neither approach is "better" - they're optimized for different moments. Here's both sides, plainly:

```text
                      COMPILED (translate-ahead)      INTERPRETED (translate-as-you-go)
                      e.g. Go, Rust, C                e.g. Python, JavaScript
   ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   When it translates   once, before running          continuously, while running
   Build step?          yes - compile first           no - run the source directly
   Startup / run speed   typically faster              typically slower
   Feedback loop        slower (wait to build)         fast (edit, run, repeat)
   What you ship        an executable (machine code)   the source + an interpreter
   Runs where?          one CPU/OS it was built for    anywhere the interpreter exists
```

The single thing driving every row is *when the translation happens*. Pull that thread and the rest follows.

🪖 **War story.** A teammate switched a small data script from Python to Go "for the speed" and was baffled when, for their tiny one-second job, it didn't feel faster to *use* - they'd added a compile step to their workflow and the script was too short for the runtime speed-up to matter. Compiled-vs-interpreted isn't "fast vs slow" in the abstract; it's a trade about *where the time goes*. For a quick script you run once, the interpreter's instant start often wins; for a program that runs hard for hours, the compiler's upfront work pays off.

## Recap

1. Your **source code** is human-readable text. The **CPU** only runs **machine code** - tiny numeric instructions. Something must translate one into the other.
2. A **compiler** translates the *whole* program ahead of time into an **executable**, then steps out of the way (Go, Rust, C).
3. An **interpreter** translates *and runs* your source as it goes, every time, with no separate executable (Python, JavaScript).
4. The trade-off is all about **when** translation happens: compiled gives faster runs but needs a build step; interpreted gives instant feedback but does its translating live.
5. "Compiled" / "interpreted" describe how a language is *usually run*, not an unbreakable rule.

Now you know how your text becomes runnable instructions. Next question: once those instructions start running, the values they work with - your numbers, your text, your lists - have to *live* somewhere. Let's look at where.
