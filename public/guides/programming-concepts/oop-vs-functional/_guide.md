# Object-Oriented vs Functional, Honestly

You've seen the arguments. One person swears object-oriented programming is bloated ceremony; another says functional programming is academic and unreadable. Both sound confident, and you're left wondering whether you picked the "wrong" side by accident - or whether you even picked a side at all.

Here's the calm version of the truth: **these are two ways of organizing code, not two warring religions.** Object-oriented programming (OOP) bundles data together with the behavior that acts on it. Functional programming (FP) treats functions as the main building block and avoids changing data in place. Each solves a real problem. Most languages you already use - Python, JavaScript, C#, Scala - let you do both, and most real codebases mix them.

This guide gives you the working mental model for each, with small annotated examples, then an honest comparison of where each one actually shines. No dogma, no winner declared. By the end you'll read code in either style and make a deliberate choice instead of an inherited one.

## How to read this

- **Want the honest "which one should I use" answer?** Skip to [Phase 3: Honestly - Which, When?](03-which-when.md). It has the comparison table and the judgment calls, flagged as judgment.
- **Want it to finally make sense?** Read in order. Phase 1 and Phase 2 build the two mental models you'll need before the comparison in Phase 3 means anything.

## The phases

1. **[What OOP Actually Is](01-what-oop-actually-is.md)** - bundling data with behavior (objects and classes), and the three ideas people always cite - encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism - explained by the problem each one solves.
2. **[What Functional Programming Actually Is](02-what-functional-actually-is.md)** - functions as the core unit, immutability, pure functions, and composing small functions into bigger ones, and why that makes code easier to test and reason about.
3. **[Honestly: Which, When?](03-which-when.md)** - the honest truth that most real code is both, a fair comparison of where each shines, and how to choose without joining a cult.

> This guide is about the two *paradigms* and the mental models behind them. It is not a tutorial in any one language's class syntax or a deep dive into category theory - for the broader "how languages differ" picture, see [Languages Explained Like a Human](/guides/languages-explained-like-a-human).
