# Arrays & Lists - Ordered Collections

The very first container almost everyone meets is the list - a row of names, a sequence of scores, the
lines of a file. It feels simple, and most of the time it is. But there's a quiet trap: some things you do
to a list are basically free, and others look just as innocent but get slower as the list grows. By the end
of this phase you'll be able to look at a line of code and *feel* which kind you're doing.

📝 **Terminology.** An **array** is a fixed row of numbered slots laid out one after another in memory. A
**list** is the friendlier, everyday version most languages hand you (Python's `list`, JavaScript's
`Array`) - it grows and shrinks for you and hides the bookkeeping. The mental model below is the same for
both; we'll say "list" from here on, and call out the array detail only where it matters.

## The mental model: a row of numbered slots

**What it actually is.** A list is a row of slots, side by side, each holding one item, and each with a
number called its **index**. Picture a row of lockers:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  S0["Mo<br/>index 0"]:::first --> S1["Tu<br/>index 1"] --> S2["We<br/>index 2"] --> S3["Th<br/>index 3"] --> S4["Fr<br/>index 4"]:::last
  classDef first fill:#1a3a2a,stroke:#3a7a5a;
  classDef last fill:#1a3a2a,stroke:#3a7a5a;
```

📝 **Terminology.** The **index** is the slot number. Almost every language starts counting at **0**, not
1 - so the first item is at index `0`, and a list of five items has indexes `0` through `4`. This
off-by-one feeling confuses everybody at first; you stop noticing it within a week.

**Why the order matters.** A list *remembers the order you put things in*. Monday stays before Tuesday
until you change it. That's the defining feature: a list is for when sequence means something - steps in a
recipe, messages in a chat, rows in a spreadsheet.

## Reaching for an item by index - basically free

**What it does in real life.** Because the slots are laid out in a neat row, the computer can jump
*straight* to any slot just from its number. It doesn't walk past slots 0, 1, 2 to reach slot 3 - it
computes where slot 3 lives and lands on it directly. Slot #3 and slot #3000 cost the same.

```python runnable
days = ["Mo", "Tu", "We", "Th", "Fr"]

print(days[0])   # the first item
print(days[3])   # the fourth item
```
```console
Mo
Th
```
*What just happened:* `days[3]` means "give me whatever is in slot number 3." The computer went straight
there and handed it back. This jump-to-a-slot move is the list's superpower, and it's why lists are the
default container for "I have a bunch of things in order and I want item number N."

💡 **Key point.** Access *by index* is the thing lists are fastest at. If your code spends its life saying
"give me item number N," a list is exactly right.

## Adding to the end - cheap

**What it does in real life.** Sticking a new item onto the *end* of a list is usually quick: there's
almost always room just past the last slot, so the item drops into place and the list's length ticks up by
one.

```python runnable
days = ["Mo", "Tu", "We", "Th", "Fr"]
days.append("Sa")
print(days)
```
```console
['Mo', 'Tu', 'We', 'Th', 'Fr', 'Sa']
```
*What just happened:* `append` put `"Sa"` in the next slot after `"Fr"` and nothing else had to move. The
existing items kept their slots and their indexes. Appending is the natural, cheap way to grow a list.

📝 **Terminology.** "Cheap" / "fast" here means *the cost doesn't grow as the list gets bigger* - appending
to a 10-item list and a 10-million-item list feel the same. (Occasionally a growing list needs a bigger
stretch of memory and copies itself, but averaged out, appending stays cheap - see
[Big-O Without the Math Panic](/guides/big-o-without-the-math-panic) for the full picture.)

## Inserting or removing in the *middle* - this is the costly one

Here's the trap. Adding to the *end* is cheap. Adding to the *middle* is not - and the code looks almost
identical, which is exactly why it bites people.

**Why it costs.** Remember the slots are a tight row with no gaps. To squeeze a new item into slot 1,
*every item from slot 1 onward has to shuffle one slot to the right* to make room. The bigger the list, the
more items have to move.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A[A] --> X["X - inserted at index 1"] --> B[B] --> C[C] --> D[D]
```
*Inserting `X` at index 1 shoves `B`, `C`, `D` each one slot to the right to make room.*

```python runnable
letters = ["A", "B", "C", "D"]
letters.insert(1, "X")   # put "X" at index 1, shove the rest over
print(letters)
```
```console
['A', 'X', 'B', 'C', 'D']
```
*What just happened:* `insert(1, "X")` placed `"X"` at index 1 and quietly moved `B`, `C`, and `D` each one
slot to the right. For four items that's nothing - but for a list of a million items where you keep
inserting near the front, all that shuffling adds up to real, noticeable slowness. Removing from the middle
works the same way in reverse: everything after the gap shuffles *left* to close it.

⚠️ **Gotcha.** A list inserting/removing at the *end* is cheap; doing it at the *front or middle* gets
slower as the list grows. They look like the same operation in your code - `append` vs `insert(0, ...)` -
but one is free and the other isn't. If you find yourself constantly inserting at the front of a big list,
that's a signal you might want a different structure - see
[Phase 4: Stacks, Queues & Linked Lists](04-stacks-queues-and-linked-lists.md) for the "queue," which is
built exactly for cheap add/remove at *both* ends.

## Searching for a value - you have to look through them

One more honest limitation. A list is fast at "give me item number N," but it's *not* fast at "is the value
`"We"` in here, and where?" To answer that, the computer has no shortcut - it walks the slots one by one,
checking each, until it finds a match or runs out.

```python runnable
days = ["Mo", "Tu", "We", "Th", "Fr"]
print("We" in days)        # is it present?
print(days.index("We"))    # at which slot?
```
```console
True
2
```
*What just happened:* `"We" in days` made the computer scan from the front, comparing each item, until it
hit `"We"` at slot 2. On a short list that's instant, but on a huge list, searching by *value* this way gets
slower the bigger it grows - every item is a potential stop along the walk.

Hold onto that limitation, because it's the exact pain the next phase solves. When your real question is
"do I have this thing, and what's attached to it?" - a list makes you walk the whole row, and there's a
container built to answer that *instantly* instead.

## Recap

1. A **list** is an ordered row of numbered **slots**; the slot number is its **index** (counting from `0`).
2. **Order is preserved** - use a list when sequence matters.
3. **Access by index** (`days[3]`) is basically free, no matter how big the list is.
4. **Appending to the end** is cheap.
5. **Inserting/removing in the middle or front** is costly - everything after has to shuffle over.
6. **Searching by value** (`"We" in days`) means walking the list item by item - fine for small lists,
   slow for big ones.

That last point - slow lookup by value - is the doorway to the next container. Let's open it.
