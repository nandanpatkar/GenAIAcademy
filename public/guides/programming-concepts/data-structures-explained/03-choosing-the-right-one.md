# Choosing the Right One

You've met the three containers and seen what each is built for. This phase is the payoff: a way to pick the
right one in a few seconds, and the comparison table to glance at when you forget. There's no clever theory
here - picking a data structure comes down to honestly answering what your code keeps *asking* of the data.

If you're here mid-task and just need an answer, the three questions below and the table will get you sorted.
If you want the reasoning, it's all underneath.

## The cheat-card: three questions

Ask these in order. The first "yes" usually points you at your container.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Q1{"Order or position<br/>matters?"} -->|yes| List[use a LIST]
  Q1 -->|no| Q2{"Look up by KEY<br/>for a value?"}
  Q2 -->|yes| Map[use a MAP / dict]
  Q2 -->|no| Q3{"Only care if present,<br/>no duplicates?"}
  Q3 -->|yes| Set[use a SET]
```

Most everyday code is one of these three. When two seem to fit, ask which question your code asks *most
often* - that's the operation you want to be fast.

## The comparison table

Here's what each container is fast and slow at, side by side. "Fast" means the cost barely changes as the
data grows; "slow" means it gets worse the bigger the collection gets.

| Operation | List | Map (dict) | Set |
|---|---|---|---|
| Get item by **index/position** (`x[3]`) | **fast** | n/a | n/a |
| Get value by **key** (`x["ada"]`) | n/a | **fast** | n/a |
| Check "**is this value present?**" (`v in x`) | slow (walks it) | **fast** (by key) | **fast** |
| **Add to the end** | **fast** | **fast** | **fast** |
| **Insert/remove in the middle or front** | slow (shuffles) | n/a | n/a |
| Keeps **order**? | **yes** | no | no |
| Allows **duplicates**? | yes | keys: no | no |

Read the table as a map of strengths, not a scoreboard. Each container is *fast at the thing it's for* and
slower at (or doesn't do at all) the things it isn't for - there's no winner, only a fit.

## Big-O, as intuition only

You'll hear people describe these speeds with **Big-O notation** - terms like `O(1)` and `O(n)`. Don't let
the symbols scare you; for now they're just two plain ideas:

- 📝 **"Constant"** (written `O(1)`) - the cost **doesn't grow** as the collection gets bigger. Grabbing
  `list[3]` or fetching `map["ada"]` costs the same whether there are 10 items or 10 million. This is the
  "fast" in the table above.
- 📝 **"Grows with size"** (written `O(n)`) - the cost **gets bigger as the collection grows**, because the
  work scales with the number of items. Searching a list by value, or inserting at its front and shuffling
  everything over, is this kind. This is the "slow" in the table.

That's genuinely all you need to choose well: *is this operation constant, or does it grow with size, and is
it the operation I do most?* The formal definitions, the math, and the in-between speeds belong to
[Big-O Without the Math Panic](/guides/big-o-without-the-math-panic) - chase them when you're optimizing real
code, not before.

## The classic slowdown: a list where you needed a map

Here's the mistake that quietly tanks more beginner programs than any other, and now you can see exactly why
it happens.

Say you have a big list of users and you keep checking "is this user already in here?" A list feels like the
obvious home for "a bunch of users," so people write:

```python
users = ["ada", "linus", "grace", ...]   # imagine 100,000 names

# called over and over in a loop:
if "grace" in users:
    ...
```
*What just happened:* every single `"grace" in users` makes the computer **walk the list** from the front,
comparing names one at a time (that's the "grows with size" cost from Phase 1). Do that check thousands of
times over a list of a hundred thousand, and your program slows to a crawl - not because anything is
*broken*, but because you picked a container that's slow at the exact question you keep asking.

The fix is to ask: *what does this code keep doing?* It keeps checking membership. That's question 3 - so it
wants a **set**:

```python
users = {"ada", "linus", "grace", ...}   # a set, built for membership

if "grace" in users:                     # fast, no walking
    ...
```
*What just happened:* the membership check now uses hashing to jump straight to the answer instead of
scanning (the "constant" cost from Phase 2). Same-looking code, the bottleneck gone. If you also needed
*data attached* to each user - their email, their last login - you'd reach for a **map** (`users["grace"]`)
for the same reason.

⚠️ **Gotcha.** Reaching for a list when you needed a map or set is *the* classic beginner slowdown. The
tell: you're repeatedly doing `something in my_list` or scanning a list to find a matching item. Both are
"grows with size" on a list and "constant" on a set/map. When you catch yourself searching a list by value
again and again, that's your cue to switch containers - and you'll often watch a sluggish program turn
instant.

## Putting it all together

You came in able to write code but unsure which container to grab. Now you have a real model:

- A **list** is an ordered row of slots - perfect when **sequence or position** matters, fast to read by
  index and to append, slow to search by value or edit the middle.
- A **map** files **values under keys** - perfect when you look things up by a meaningful key and want the
  value back instantly.
- A **set** keeps **unique items** with **fast membership** - perfect for deduping and "have I seen this?"
- The deciding question is never "which is best" but "**what does my code keep asking?**" Match the container
  to that question and the right one is usually obvious.

That's the everyday toolkit. When you're ready to go deeper, [Phase 4](04-stacks-queues-and-linked-lists.md)
covers stacks, queues, and linked lists, and [Trees & Binary Search Trees](/guides/trees-and-binary-search-trees)
picks up from there. Until then, you have more than enough to choose well and write code that stays fast as
it grows.

## Recap

1. **Three questions** decide it: order/position → **list**; lookup by key → **map**; uniqueness/membership
   → **set**.
2. The **comparison table** shows each container is fast at what it's *for* and slow at what it isn't.
3. **Big-O is just intuition** for now: **"constant"** (doesn't grow) vs **"grows with size."**
4. The **classic slowdown** is using a list where you needed a map or set - repeatedly searching a list by
   value is "grows with size"; a set/map makes it "constant."
5. Always ask **"what does my code keep doing?"** and make *that* operation the fast one.
