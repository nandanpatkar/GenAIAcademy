# Pointers and References

You change one variable, and a completely different one changes with it. You call a function, hand it your data, and somehow the function edits the original instead of a copy. You dereference something that turns out to be empty and the program dies on a line that looks perfectly innocent. All three of these trace back to the same idea: some variables don't hold a value — they hold *directions to where the value lives*. This guide builds that mental model once, shows you how it shows up differently across languages, and then walks through the gotchas that come from it.

## How to read this

Read it in order. Phase 1 builds the core picture — a box holding an address instead of a value — using nothing language-specific. Phase 2 shows how that one idea gets dressed up differently in different languages: explicit pointers, implicit references, and plain values that don't play this game at all. Phase 3 is the payoff: the three bugs this idea is responsible for, and why each one happens.

## The phases

1. [A box with an address instead of a value](01-a-box-with-an-address.md) — the mental model: values, variables, and what it means for a variable to point somewhere else.
2. [Pointers vs. references across languages](02-pointers-vs-references-across-languages.md) — explicit pointers, implicit references, and true value types, kept language-agnostic.
3. [The classic gotchas](03-the-classic-gotchas.md) — null dereference, dangling pointers, and the shared-reference surprise.
