# Living with flags

You've got the mental model: code can be deployed and still dark. Now the practical question — what do you actually *do* with that switch? It turns out a single boolean, once you can target *who* sees it, covers four very different jobs that teams used to handle with four very different (and more painful) tools. Let's walk each one the way you'd hit them in a real week.

## The gradual rollout: don't release to everyone at once

You finished a feature. The tests pass. The instinct is to flip it on for all users and move on. Resist it. The flag lets you turn it on for a *slice* and grow the slice only if the dashboards stay calm.

A rollout is a sequence of flag states, not one flip:

```text
1. Enable for: my own account            → click around, sanity check
2. Enable for: internal team             → real humans, real data
3. Enable for: 1% of users               → watch error rate, latency, support
4. Enable for: 10%                        → still calm? keep going
5. Enable for: 100%                       → fully released
```

*What just happened:* you converted a binary launch into a dimmer switch. At each step the blast radius of a bug is capped — a problem at 1% touches 1% of users, and you caught it before it reached the other 99%. This is what people mean by a *canary release*: a small group goes first, like the canary in the mine.

The targeting logic usually lives in the flag service, but conceptually it's plain:

```js
function isEnabled(flagName, user) {
  const flag = lookupFlag(flagName);        // current config, fetched at runtime
  if (flag.allowList.includes(user.id)) return true;   // explicit early access
  return hashUserId(user.id) % 100 < flag.percentage;  // stable % bucketing
}
```

*What just happened:* hashing the user id and comparing against a percentage means the *same* user lands in the same bucket every call. That stability matters — without it, a user at 10% rollout would flicker between old and new on every page load, which feels broken even when nothing is wrong.

> Roll out by percentage of *users*, not percentage of *requests*. A single confused user seeing the new feature half the time is a worse experience than a clean 10% who consistently get it.

## The kill switch: the reason flags earn their keep

This is the payoff Phase 1 promised. The new feature is at 10%, the error rate spikes, and you don't reach for a rollback build. You flip one value.

```bash
# Feature is misbehaving in production. One command, no redeploy.
$ flagctl disable new-checkout-flow
✓ new-checkout-flow → OFF (propagating to all instances ~10s)
```

*What just happened:* every server re-reads the flag within seconds and routes all traffic back to the old, known-good path. No pipeline ran. No artifact was rebuilt. The mean-time-to-recovery dropped from "however long a deploy takes" to "however long a config propagation takes" — typically seconds.

A kill switch is most valuable around the things most likely to go wrong: a new third-party integration, an expensive query, a risky algorithm. Wrap those in a flag *specifically* so you have an off button, even if you never plan a gradual rollout. The flag exists to fail safely, not to release slowly.

## A/B tests: the flag as a measuring tool

The same targeting machinery answers a different question. Instead of "is this safe?" you ask "which version performs better?" Split users into groups, show each group a variant, and compare a metric.

```text
Group A (50%):  old button copy   → measured conversion: baseline
Group B (50%):  new button copy   → measured conversion: +4.1%
```

*What just happened:* the flag stopped being a pure on/off and became a *which-variant* selector. The mechanism is identical — stable per-user bucketing — but the goal shifted from risk control to learning. (One honest caveat: a real A/B test needs enough traffic and a proper significance check before you trust a difference. The flag delivers the split; it doesn't do the statistics for you.)

## Trunk-based development: flags as the unlock

Here's the workflow consequence that surprises people. When unfinished features can be deployed dark, long-lived feature branches stop being necessary. Everyone commits to the main branch ("trunk") in small pieces; half-built work hides behind an off flag and ships with every deploy, harming nobody because no one can reach it.

```text
Branch-heavy:  feature lives on a branch for 3 weeks → painful merge → big-bang release
Trunk-based:   small commits to main daily, feature behind an off flag → flip on when ready
```

*What just happened:* the bottom row eliminated the giant merge and the big-bang release. The work integrated continuously, in tiny increments, while staying invisible to users. The flag is what makes "merge unfinished code to main" sane instead of reckless.

## For builders

These four uses share one engine: a runtime-changeable value plus per-user targeting. You can start with the crudest possible version — a JSON file your app re-reads, or a single environment variable — and it'll genuinely work for a small team. Reach for a hosted flag service when you need per-user targeting, an audit trail of who flipped what, and instant propagation across many instances. Don't buy that complexity on day one; grow into it when a config file stops being enough.

    "explain": "Half-built work hides behind an off flag and ships with every deploy harming nobody, which removes the need for long-lived feature branches."
