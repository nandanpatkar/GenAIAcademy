# Running AI Locally (Ollama)

Most AI you use lives in someone else's data center. You type, your words travel to a company's servers, a model answers, and the reply comes back. That works well, but it means every prompt leaves your machine, every request can cost money, and nothing works on a plane with no Wi-Fi. Running a model locally flips all three. The model sits on your own computer, answers from there, and never phones home.

Ollama is the tool that made this approachable. It packages an open model, downloads it with one command, and gives you a chat prompt in your terminal - no accounts, no API keys, no setup ritual. This guide is for normal smart people who are curious about local AI: founders weighing privacy, writers who want a draft buddy offline, anyone who has wondered whether they can skip the monthly bill. You do not need to be an engineer, and there is no math or model-training here.

Across three phases you will get the why, the how, and the honest catch. Phase 1 lays out the real reasons to run a model yourself - and who should not bother. Phase 2 walks you from nothing to a working chat in a few commands, plus the rough hardware it takes. Phase 3 is the part marketing pages skip: where a local model falls short of a frontier cloud model, and how to tell which job needs which tool. By the end you will know whether local AI fits your work, and how to try it in an afternoon.
