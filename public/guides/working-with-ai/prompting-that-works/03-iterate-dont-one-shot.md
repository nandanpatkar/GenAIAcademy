# Iterate, Do Not One-Shot

The people who struggle most with AI tend to treat it like a search box: type once, judge the result, walk away disappointed. The people who get real value treat it like a conversation with a sharp but literal-minded assistant - they steer. The first answer is a draft, not a verdict. Your job is to push it toward what you actually wanted.

This is the mindset that matters more than any single pattern. You will rarely get the perfect output on the first try, and that's fine, because you don't have to.

## Refine in small, specific moves

When an answer is close but not right, don't rewrite your whole prompt. Tell it what to change.

```text
Good start. Make it warmer, cut the second paragraph, and end with a clear
ask instead of trailing off.
```

Specific feedback beats vague feedback every time. "Make it better" gives the model nothing to aim at; "shorter, less formal, lead with the main point" gives it three concrete targets. Treat each reply like notes to an editor.

## Correct it directly

When it gets a fact wrong or misunderstands you, say so plainly and give the correction.

```text
No - the deadline is Friday, not next month. Redo the timeline with that.
```

You don't need to be polite or elaborate. Clear correction is the fastest path. And it's worth saying again: these tools state wrong things confidently, so when an answer involves facts, names, dates, numbers, or quotes, assume nothing until you've checked it yourself. Iterating fixes tone and shape reliably; it does not magically make the model truthful.

## Build on what's working

The conversation has memory of itself. Once you've given it your context and a couple of corrections, it's "warmed up" - it knows your situation, your voice, your constraints. Use that. Ask follow-ups instead of starting over: *"Now write a shorter version for a text message."* *"Give me three subject lines for that email."* You're getting compounding returns on the context you already spent effort providing.

## Know when to start fresh

Here's the part people miss: sometimes the best move is to abandon the chat entirely.

A conversation can get tangled. You corrected it three times, it keeps drifting back to an early wrong assumption, the thread is now a mess of half-right attempts. When that happens, the accumulated context is working *against* you - the model keeps anchoring on the confusion you've been building up together. Fighting it is slower than a clean restart.

Signs it's time for a new chat:

- It keeps repeating a mistake even after you've corrected it more than twice.
- The conversation has wandered far from the original topic and you want to return to it cleanly.
- The thread has gotten very long and answers feel like they're losing the plot or contradicting earlier ones.
- You've changed your mind about what you want and half the chat is now leading the wrong direction.

When you restart, you don't lose what you learned. You learned how to ask. Open a fresh chat and write one clean prompt that bakes in everything the messy conversation taught you - the right context, the constraints you discovered you needed, the format that worked. That single well-formed prompt often beats twenty rounds of correction.

```text
[fresh chat]
Write a 4-email welcome sequence for new subscribers to my coffee
roastery's newsletter. Friendly, first-name tone. Each email under 120
words, one clear call to action. Email 1 welcomes them and shares our
story; emails 2-4 each feature one bean and a brewing tip. End each with a
soft nudge to shop.
```

That prompt is the distilled output of everything you'd have learned the hard way in a tangled thread - written once, cleanly.

## The whole skill in one line

Be clear about what you want, give it the context only you have, lean on a pattern or two when it helps, and keep steering until it's right - or start fresh when steering stops working. No magic words. Only a conversation you know how to run.
