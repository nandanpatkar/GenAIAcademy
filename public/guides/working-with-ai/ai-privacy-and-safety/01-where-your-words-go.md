# Where Your Words Go

When you type into a chatbot and hit send, your text doesn't stay on your laptop. It travels over the internet to the AI company's servers, gets processed by the model, and the reply comes back. That round trip is unavoidable for any cloud chatbot - the model is too big to run on your device. So the real questions aren't "does my data leave?" (it does) but "what do they do with it once it arrives, and how long do they hang on to it?"

There are three things happening to your words, and people mix them up constantly. Keep them separate in your head.

## Three different things, not one

**Processing.** To answer you, the system has to read what you sent. This is true everywhere and isn't optional. Nobody can help you write the email without reading the email.

**Retention.** After answering, most services keep a copy of the conversation for some period - to show you your history, to debug problems, to catch abuse. This is storage, and storage is where data sits waiting for a breach, a subpoena, or an employee who shouldn't be looking.

**Training.** Separately, the company may use your conversations to improve their future models. This is the one people fear most, and it's the one most often turned off by default on paid and business tiers. Training is not the same as retention - a service can keep your chats for thirty days without ever using them to train anything.

The headline you want: training and retention are two different switches. Check both.

## Does it train on my data?

Depends entirely on which account you're using.

- **Free and personal consumer accounts** often use your conversations to train future models by default. There's usually a setting to turn this off, buried somewhere in privacy or data controls. Most people never touch it.
- **Paid consumer plans** vary. Some still train unless you opt out; some don't. Read the specific product's page - don't assume paying means private.
- **Business, team, and enterprise plans** from the major providers generally do *not* train on your inputs by default, and say so contractually. This is the single biggest reason to push your company toward a proper business agreement rather than everyone using personal logins.

The practical move: in any account you use for real work, go find the "improve the model for everyone" or "data controls" toggle and turn it off. It takes two minutes and removes the scariest possibility.

One honest caveat: turning off training does not mean your text vanishes. It still gets sent, still gets processed, and is usually still retained for a window. Off-training is necessary, not sufficient.

## How long do they keep it?

Retention windows differ by provider and by plan, and they change, so treat any specific number as "check it yourself." The shape is usually:

| Tier | Typical retention behavior |
|---|---|
| Free / consumer | Kept until you delete; deleted chats often purged within ~30 days |
| Business / enterprise | Configurable; admins may set or shorten retention |
| "Temporary" / incognito chat modes | Short window (often ~30 days) for abuse review, then gone, not used for training |

Two things worth knowing. First, even when you delete a conversation, there's frequently a lag - a backend copy may persist for weeks for safety and legal reasons before it's actually erased. Second, legal holds override everything: if a company is required to preserve data for a lawsuit, your "deleted" chats can be kept regardless of the normal schedule. That has already happened in real litigation involving major AI providers, where a court ordered chat logs preserved that would otherwise have been deleted.

## Consumer vs business: why it's a different animal

The gap is bigger than a nicer interface. A consumer account is a deal between you and the AI company under their standard terms. A business or enterprise account is a contract your organization signs, and that contract typically includes: no training on your data, an admin who controls retention and access, the ability to delete data on demand, and security commitments (encryption, access logs, sometimes compliance certifications like SOC 2). Some offer "zero data retention" arrangements where nothing is stored after the response is generated.

```text
Consumer login:  you  ->  AI company's standard terms  ->  maybe trained, kept a while
Business account: your org  ->  signed contract  ->  no training, admin-controlled retention
```

This matters for one reason above all: if you're doing work that touches anyone else's data - customers, patients, employees - a personal account quietly makes promises on your employer's behalf that your employer never agreed to. The business tier exists precisely so those promises are written down and enforceable.

The takeaway for this phase: every chatbot keeps and may learn from what you type, the defaults differ wildly by account type, and the fix is mostly about *which account* you're typing into, not how careful you are with any single message. Next, we get specific about the messages themselves - what should never go into a general chatbot no matter how the account is configured.
