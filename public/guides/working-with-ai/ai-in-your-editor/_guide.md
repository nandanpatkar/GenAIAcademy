# AI in Your Editor

Most people meet AI through a chat window in a browser tab. But if you write code, configs, scripts, or even structured documents, the AI that helps you most lives somewhere quieter: inside the editor you already work in. It watches what you type and offers the next few lines. It answers questions about the file in front of you. It can rewrite a whole function on request. This is a different shape of help than a chatbot, and it pays to understand the shape before you lean on it.

This guide is for anyone who edits text in a real tool - VS Code, a JetBrains IDE, or a purpose-built editor like Cursor - and wants to add AI without getting burned. You do not need to be an engineer. You do need to understand what the editor is actually doing when it suggests something, where its blind spots are, and the single habit that separates people who get faster from people who quietly ship broken work.

We move in three steps. First, the spectrum: from inline autocomplete to a chat that has read your project, and what tools like GitHub Copilot and Cursor each bring to it. Second, context - the real skill of editor AI is feeding it the right surrounding material so its suggestions fit your code instead of some generic version. Third, the discipline that holds it all together: you read every change before you accept it, because the failure mode here is not gibberish, it's code that looks right and isn't.
