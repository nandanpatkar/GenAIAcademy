# When It Has to Run Itself: Pipelines

You've got a clean database and a query that answers your question perfectly. There's just one human left
in the loop, and it's you — opening your laptop every Monday to run that query, format the result, and
send it on. It works. Until the Monday you're sick, or busy, or you fat-finger the date and ship a wrong
number to the whole team.

That last human step is the pain this phase is about. When the work must happen *reliably, on a schedule,
without anyone remembering to do it*, you've reached the third stage: you build a **pipeline.**

## The mental model: a recipe the computer follows for you

📝 **Terminology.** A **pipeline** is a defined sequence of steps — get the data, transform it, store or
send the result — written down as code or configuration so a computer can run it automatically, the same
way every time.

Remember the "every Monday, by hand" list from Phase 1? A pipeline is that exact list, except it's
written down precisely enough that a machine can follow it — and then set to run on its own.

```text
   In your head (Phase 1):          As a pipeline (Phase 3):
   ─────────────────────            ────────────────────────
   "download the export"      →     1. pull this week's orders   ┐
   "clean the dates"          →     2. transform / clean         │  written as code,
   "run the totals"           →     3. run the summary query     ├─ runs automatically
   "email the result"         →     4. write result + notify     ┘  every Monday 6am
   (you, remembering)         →     a scheduler, never forgetting
```

*What just happened:* The process moved out of your head and into something durable. The steps are no
longer a habit you perform — they're an artifact that exists, can be read, can be fixed, and runs whether
or not you're awake. That single shift is the whole idea of a pipeline.

📝 **Terminology.** A **scheduler** is the piece that triggers the pipeline on a timetable — "every day at
6am," "every hour," "every Monday." It's the part that replaces *you remembering*.

## What a pipeline buys you

### Reliability

A human doing manual steps will eventually skip one, or do it slightly differently, or not be there at
all. A pipeline does the identical steps every run, and tells you when something goes wrong instead of
quietly shipping a bad result.

```text
   Manual:    works ✓  works ✓  YOU'RE ON VACATION ✗  works ✓  typo'd the date ✗
   Pipeline:  works ✓  works ✓  works ✓               works ✓  works ✓
```

*What just happened:* The gaps and the slip-ups — the failures that come from a person being in the loop
— are designed out. The pipeline isn't smarter than you; it's just tireless and consistent in a way no
human can be every single week.

### Reproducibility

Because the steps are written down as code, the process is no longer a mystery only you can perform.
Anyone can read exactly what happens, run it again and get the same answer, and trace any number back to
the steps that produced it.

*What just happened:* This is the cure for Phase 1's deepest problem — the work that lived only in your
head. Now "how was this number calculated?" has a real answer you can point at, and "can you run it
again?" is a yes, not a panic.

### Scale

A pipeline doesn't get tired or bored, so the things that made manual work impractical stop mattering.
Run it hourly instead of weekly. Process a hundred files instead of one. Feed ten reports instead of one.
The marginal cost of "do it again" drops to almost nothing.

**Why this saves you later.** Every "can we also do this every day / for every region / for every
client?" request stops being "that's a lot more of my time" and becomes "change one setting." The work
scales without your hours scaling with it.

## What a pipeline costs

Here's the honest other side, and it's the whole reason you don't start here. A pipeline is **software**,
and software has to be built and looked after.

- **Up-front engineering.** Someone has to write the steps as code, connect the pieces, and set up the
  schedule. That's real work, and it's slower than just doing the task by hand once.
- **It can break in new ways.** The source format changes, a server is down, credentials expire — and now
  there's a *system* that can fail, not just a task you forgot. You need it to alert you when it does.
- **Ongoing maintenance.** Pipelines need monitoring, occasional fixing, and updating as the data around
  them changes. You've traded "I redo this every week" for "I keep this running."

```text
   THE TRADE
   ─────────
   manual:    cheap to start,  expensive forever  (your time, every single run)
   pipeline:  costly to build, cheap to run        (engineering up front, then it runs itself)
```

*What just happened:* You're not getting automation for free — you're paying for it once, up front, in
engineering, in exchange for paying almost nothing per run afterward. Whether that's a good deal depends
entirely on how often the work repeats and how much it matters when it's wrong.

## ⚠️ Match the tool to the scale — don't over-engineer

This is the most important judgment call in the whole guide: **a pipeline is the right answer only when
the work genuinely repeats and genuinely matters.** Building one for a task you'll do twice is a classic,
expensive mistake — you'll spend days automating something a five-minute manual job would have handled,
then spend more days maintaining it.

A rough guide to where each stage earns its keep:

| The work is… | Reach for… |
|---|---|
| One-time, exploratory, small, just you | A **spreadsheet** |
| Shared, growing, queried often, multi-person | A **database + SQL** |
| Repeating on a schedule, must be reliable, no human in the loop | A **pipeline** |

The honest rule of thumb: do it by hand until the manual cost clearly outweighs the cost of automating
it. Let the pain make the case. A task you do once a quarter rarely justifies a pipeline; a report ten
people depend on every morning almost always does.

## Where this goes next

This phase is the *when* and *why* of pipelines. The *how* — the patterns for actually building them, the
difference between extracting-then-transforming and the reverse, the tools people use — is a guide of its
own: [ETL & ELT Pipelines](/guides/etl-elt-pipelines). When the trade-off above tips toward "yes, build
it," that's where you go to build it well.

And if you found yourself nodding along to this whole progression — spreadsheet to database to automated
pipeline — you've just described the heart of a whole discipline. That field has a name and a map:
[What Is Data Engineering](/guides/what-is-data-engineering).

## Recap

1. A **pipeline** is your manual "every Monday" steps written as code and run automatically by a
   **scheduler** — the process moved out of your head and into something durable.
2. It buys you **reliability** (same steps, every time, no skipped weeks), **reproducibility** (anyone can
   read and rerun it), and **scale** (do it hourly, for everything, without more of your hours).
3. It costs **up-front engineering**, **new ways to break**, and **ongoing maintenance** — automation is
   paid for once, in advance.
4. **Match the tool to the scale.** Spreadsheet for one-time work, database for shared querying, pipeline
   only when the work truly repeats and truly matters. Don't over-engineer.

You now have the whole arc. The next time a data task lands on your desk, you can place it — and pick the
tool that fits, not the one that's fanciest.
