# When It Breaks at Scale

Everything in Phase 2 works beautifully — on one server. You demo it, it's instant, everyone's happy.
Then traffic grows, you add a second server behind a load balancer, and realtime quietly breaks in a way
that's maddening to debug: messages arrive for *some* users and vanish for others, seemingly at random.
Nothing is wrong with your code. The problem is that a persistent connection and a stateless load
balancer fundamentally disagree, and this phase is about that fight.

This is the payoff phase. Once you see *why* one server is easy and many is hard, the whole landscape of
"realtime at scale" — sticky sessions, backplanes, fan-out — stops being jargon and becomes one
problem with a couple of standard solutions.

## Why one server is easy and many is hard

On a single server, every connected client is *right there* — they're entries in one in-memory list. To
broadcast a message, you loop over the list and write to each. Done.

Connections are long-lived and *pinned to whichever server accepted them.* Alice's WebSocket lives on
Server A; Bob's lives on Server B. Now Alice sends a chat message. It arrives at Server A. Server A loops
over *its* list of connections — which doesn't include Bob. Bob never hears it. The message is stranded
on the wrong machine.

```mermaid

  A[Alice] -->|connected to| S1[Server A]
  B[Bob] -->|connected to| S2[Server B]
  A -->|sends message| S1
  S1 -.->|knows only A| A
  S1 -.-x|can't reach Bob| B
```
Alice's message reached Server A, but Bob's connection lives on Server B. Server A has no way to push to
a client it isn't holding. With persistent connections, your clients are scattered across machines, and
no single machine can see them all.

📝 **Terminology.** This is the **fan-out** problem: one incoming event has to reach *many* connected
clients, but those clients are spread across servers that don't share memory. Solving fan-out is the
core of scaling any realtime system.

## Problem one: the load balancer keeps cutting the line

Before fan-out even bites, there's a more basic break. A normal load balancer spreads each *request*
across servers — that's its whole job. But a WebSocket or SSE stream is *one* long-lived connection that
must stay on the server that's holding it. Worse, the handshake and the upgrade can land on different
servers, and the connection dies before it starts.

**The fix: sticky sessions.** You configure the load balancer so that once a client lands on a server,
it *stays* on that server for the life of the connection (often keyed by a cookie or source IP).

```text
Without stickiness:  Alice's upgrade → Server A
                     Alice's frames  → Server B   ✗ (B never saw the handshake — dies)

With stickiness:     Alice's upgrade → Server A
                     Alice's frames  → Server A   ✓ (same server, connection survives)
```
Sticky sessions pin a client to one server so the long-lived connection isn't ripped apart by ordinary
load balancing. It's the first thing to check when WebSockets "randomly" disconnect behind a load
balancer — and a config most teams forget until it bites.

⚠️ **Stickiness is necessary but not sufficient.** Pinning Alice to Server A keeps *her* connection
alive, but it does nothing to get her message to Bob on Server B. Sticky sessions fix the connection
problem; they don't fix fan-out. People frequently turn on stickiness, see connections stabilize, and
are baffled that cross-server messages still vanish.

## Problem two: getting the message to the other servers

To deliver Alice's message to Bob, Server A needs a way to shout to *every* server "here's a message for
room `general`," and each server then pushes it to its own local connections in that room. That shared
shout-channel is a **backplane**, and it's almost always a pub/sub system.

**How it works.**
1. Every server **subscribes** to the backplane (commonly Redis pub/sub, or a message broker).
2. Alice's message hits Server A. Server A **publishes** it to the backplane instead of only looping its
   own list.
3. The backplane **fans it out** to every subscribed server.
4. Each server pushes the message to *its* local connections for that room. Bob, on Server B, finally
   gets it.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A[Alice] --> S1[Server A]
  S1 -->|publish| PS[(Pub/Sub backplane)]
  PS -->|fan-out| S1
  PS -->|fan-out| S2[Server B]
  S2 --> B[Bob]
```
No single server has to know every client anymore. Servers only know their *own* connections; the
backplane is the shared nervous system that carries every message to every server. This one pattern —
publish to a backplane, fan out to local connections — is how essentially all large realtime systems
scale.

🪖 **War story.** A chat app worked flawlessly in staging (one server) and broke the day it scaled to
three in production. Messages reached maybe a third of users — exactly the fraction who happened to share
a server with the sender. The team chased "dropped packets" for a week. The actual fix was one
component they'd never added because they'd never needed it on one box: a Redis pub/sub backplane. The
lesson — realtime bugs that only appear with more than one server are almost always fan-out.

💡 **Key point.** SSE has the *exact same* fan-out problem as WebSockets. It's one-directional, but the
server-to-many-clients broadcast still has to reach clients scattered across machines. SSE being simpler
on the connection side does not make it simpler to scale the *broadcast* — you still need a backplane.

## The honest tradeoff: cost grows with connections

Persistent connections don't scale like stateless requests. A stateless API server can handle a request
and forget it; a realtime server holds *every* connection open simultaneously, each consuming memory and
a file descriptor whether or not it's doing anything. Ten thousand idle WebSockets still cost ten
thousand connections.

That reframes the whole "which pattern" question one last time:

- **Polling** spreads load across short requests your existing infrastructure already handles — no sticky
  sessions, no backplane, no held connections. For rare updates it's not the lazy choice, it's the
  *operationally cheapest* one.
- **SSE** needs a backplane for fan-out but inherits the browser's reconnect and rides plain HTTP/2 — the
  middle of the road.
- **WebSockets** need sticky sessions, a backplane, *and* your own reconnect/heartbeat logic. Powerful,
  and the most to operate.

⚠️ **Don't pay for realtime you don't use.** Every persistent connection is a standing cost and a thing
that can break at scale. If a feature is fine updating on the user's next action, give it nothing. If it
needs live data one way, SSE. Only the genuinely two-way, high-traffic features have earned WebSockets
and the backplane that comes with them.

## For builders

When you design a realtime feature, design the *scaled* version on paper from day one, even if you ship
single-server first. Ask: when there are N servers, how does a message reach a client on a different one?
If the answer isn't "via a backplane," you have a bug that's invisible until your second server. And keep
climbing *down* the ladder when you can — the cheapest realtime system is the one that's actually plain
polling because the data didn't move fast enough to justify more.

For the cross-system cousin of this problem — services handing events to each other rather than to
browsers — the durable, queue-based tools live in [Webhooks & Message
Queues](/guides/webhooks-and-message-queues); a pub/sub backplane is the realtime, in-memory relative of
those same ideas.

## Recap

1. **One server is easy** (one in-memory list of clients); **many servers is hard** because connections
   are pinned to whichever machine accepted them.
2. **Sticky sessions** keep a long-lived connection on one server so the load balancer doesn't tear it
   apart — necessary, but it does *not* solve fan-out.
3. **Fan-out** (one event → many clients across servers) is solved with a **pub/sub backplane**: servers
   publish to it and each pushes to its own local connections. SSE needs this too.
4. **Connection cost is the real tradeoff.** Polling rides existing infra; SSE adds a backplane;
   WebSockets add stickiness, a backplane, and DIY reconnect. Pick the simplest that fits, and design the
   N-server version up front.

That's the whole arc: HTTP can't push, three patterns fake or build the push, and at scale they all bow
to the same fan-out problem. Reach for the lightest tool that does the job, and you'll ship realtime that
stays calm at 3am.
