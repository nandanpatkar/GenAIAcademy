# GraphQL, Explained

You've built a screen against a REST API and felt the friction: one endpoint hands you a wall of fields you'll never use, while the three things you actually need live behind three separate requests. You stitch them together on the client, write yet another `/users/:id/with-everything` endpoint, and quietly wonder if there's a better way.

There is: instead of the server deciding what each endpoint returns, the *client* asks for exactly the fields it wants and gets exactly those back, in a single request. That's GraphQL's whole pitch. The catch is that it moves the difficulty around rather than deleting it — and this guide is honest about where it lands, plus when REST is still the better call.

## How to read this

- **Want to know if GraphQL is even worth it?** Skim [Phase 1: The Problem REST Leaves](01-the-problem-rest-leaves.md) for the motivation, then jump straight to [Phase 3: The Honest Trade-offs](03-the-honest-trade-offs.md).
- **Want it to finally make sense?** Read in order — each phase builds on the last. The mental model in Phase 1 makes the machinery in Phase 2 obvious, and the trade-offs in Phase 3 only land once you've seen how it works.

## The phases

1. **[The Problem REST Leaves](01-the-problem-rest-leaves.md)** — over-fetching and under-fetching, the two everyday REST frustrations, and the one-sentence pitch GraphQL makes in response.
2. **[How GraphQL Works](02-how-graphql-works.md)** — the pieces: a typed schema (the contract), one endpoint, queries vs mutations, and the idea that the response mirrors the request. With an annotated query and its matching JSON.
3. **[The Honest Trade-offs](03-the-honest-trade-offs.md)** — what GraphQL costs you: harder caching, the N+1 problem, query-complexity and abuse concerns, and added tooling. When REST (or gRPC) is the better choice.

> This guide is the mental model and the decision, not a build tutorial. Schema-design patterns, resolver internals, subscriptions, and federation are deep topics deferred to a follow-up guide.
