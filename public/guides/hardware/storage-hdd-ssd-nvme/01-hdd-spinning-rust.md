# HDD - Spinning Rust

Before an SSD can feel like magic, you have to feel the thing it replaced: the **hard disk drive**, or
HDD - "spinning rust," as engineers affectionately call it. Everything it does - fine for some tasks,
painfully slow for others - comes down to one fact: *it has moving parts*. Data lives on a physical
surface, and to read any piece, the drive has to physically move there.

## What's actually inside

An HDD is a stack of rigid, spinning metal disks - **platters** - coated in magnetic material; data is
stored as microscopic magnetized spots on the surface. A **read/write head** floats a hair's width above
each platter on the end of a swinging arm: the platters spin continuously, the arm swings in and out to
position the head.

📝 **Terminology.** A **platter** is one spinning disk. A **track** is one of the concentric rings of data
on it (like record grooves, but separate circles, not a spiral). A **sector** is a small slice of a
track - the smallest chunk the drive reads or writes at once. Finding data = the right *track* (move the
arm) + the right *sector* (wait for the spin).

            │                                │   ╰───────╯   │
       ┌────┴────┐                           ╰───────┬───────╯

       │ pivots  │   to pick a track          arm pivots from the edge to
       └─────────┘                            reach any track on the platter
```

People picture a drive as a uniform "box of bytes" where every byte is equally far away - that's how RAM
behaves, and an HDD is the opposite: *where* data sits on the platter changes how long it takes to
reach - one smooth sweep versus hopping all over the surface.

## Why random access is slow

This is the heart of it. When you ask an HDD for data that isn't where the head currently sits, two
physical things have to happen, and you wait for both:

1. **Seek time** - the arm has to swing the head to the correct track. Mechanical movement, slow in
   computer terms.
2. **Rotational latency** - even over the right track, the head has to *wait* for the platter to spin
   until the sector it wants passes underneath. On average you wait for half a rotation.

📝 **Terminology.** **Random access** means jumping to scattered, unrelated locations - read a bit here, a
bit way over there, a bit back near the start. **Sequential access** means reading a long stretch that's all
laid out in a row. An HDD is far happier with the second.

```text
   Reading 100 scattered little files (RANDOM):

   seek → wait for spin → read · · · seek → wait for spin → read · · · (×100)
   └──────────── you pay the mechanical cost every single time ────────────┘

   Reading one big 4 GB video file (SEQUENTIAL):

   seek → wait for spin → read ▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒
   └─ pay the cost ONCE, then the head just rides the track as it streams ─┘
```

Booting an OS or launching a program reads hundreds or thousands of small files scattered across the
disk - the worst possible workload for an HDD, paying the seek-and-wait tax over and over. Copying one
enormous file is mostly sequential, so it fares far better. That's why a machine booting from an HDD
takes agonizingly long to become usable, yet copies a big movie at a perfectly tolerable speed.

⚠️ **Gotcha - "defragmenting" only ever made sense because of this physics.** On an HDD, a file whose
pieces are scattered across distant tracks (fragmented) reads as lots of little random seeks;
defragmenting rearranges the pieces to sit together so the read becomes sequential again - a genuine
speedup on an old machine. On an SSD it does nothing useful and you should never run it - there's no head
to move, so "scattered" costs nothing. (More on why in the next phase.)

## So what is an HDD still good for?

Writing the HDD off as obsolete wouldn't be honest: it stores a *lot* of data for very little money,
better than anything else. Per gigabyte, HDDs are the cheapest storage you can buy, by a wide margin, and
they come in very large capacities. For data you write once and read rarely and sequentially - backups,
archives, a media library, security-camera footage, the "bulk" tier of a NAS - the slow random access
barely matters, and the low cost per gigabyte matters a lot.

🪖 **War story.** A team put their database on big, cheap HDDs to save money, then couldn't understand why
the app crawled under load. A database does the *most* random thing imaginable - tiny reads and writes to
scattered records, constantly. It was the worst possible match. Moving the database to flash (next phase)
fixed it overnight, while the HDDs went on doing what they're good at: holding the nightly backups.

The honest summary: an HDD is a record player for your data. Smooth when it can ride one groove; slow and
clunky when it has to keep lifting the needle and hunting for a new spot. Cheap, roomy, and mechanical -
perfect for cold bulk storage, painful for anything that boots, launches, or does lots of small scattered
reads.

## Recap

1. An **HDD** stores data as magnetic spots on **spinning platters**, read by a **head** on a swinging arm -
   it has moving parts, and that's the whole story.
2. Reaching scattered data costs **seek time** (move the arm) plus **rotational latency** (wait for the spin)
   - so **random access is slow**.
3. **Sequential** reads pay that cost once and then stream, so big-file copies are fine.
4. HDDs are still the **cheapest** way to store **lots** of data - great for backups and archives, bad for
   anything that does many small scattered reads (like booting, or a database).

Now let's remove the moving parts entirely and watch what happens to that random-access tax.
