# CPU, RAM & Storage, Explained

When a computer feels fast or feels slow, it almost always comes down to three parts: the **CPU**, the **RAM**, and the **storage**. You've seen these words on every laptop ad - "8-core CPU, 16 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD" - and they were probably handed to you as numbers to compare, never as *things you understand*. That's the gap this guide closes.

By the end, "more GHz," "more cores," and "more RAM" will stop being shopping noise and start being decisions you can reason about. We'll do it one part at a time, then snap them together with a single idea - the **memory hierarchy** - that explains why they're arranged the way they are.

> ⏭️ Brand new to the parts inside a computer? Read [How a Computer Actually Works](/guides/how-a-computer-works) first - it names the whole cast. This guide zooms in on the three parts that decide speed and explains each one properly.

## How to read this

- **Trying to decode a spec sheet right now?** Each phase ends with a plain-language "what this number buys you." Jump to the part you're staring at - [the CPU](01-the-cpu-the-worker.md), [the RAM](02-ram-the-workspace.md), or [the storage](03-storage-the-filing-cabinet.md).
- **Want it to finally make sense?** Read in order. Each phase builds one part of the picture, and the last phase ties all three together.

## The phases

1. **[The CPU - the Worker](01-the-cpu-the-worker.md)** - what the processor actually does (it runs instructions in a tight fetch-and-execute loop), and what its specs mean: clock speed (GHz), cores, and a gentle look at cache. Why "more GHz/cores" helps, and where it doesn't.
2. **[RAM - the Workspace](02-ram-the-workspace.md)** - your computer's working memory: fast, but wiped the instant the power goes off. Why having *enough* matters so much, what happens when it runs out, and what "16 GB of RAM" actually buys you.
3. **[Storage - the Filing Cabinet](03-storage-the-filing-cabinet.md)** - where your stuff lives when the power's off, capacity versus speed, and the unifying idea: the **memory hierarchy** - cache, then RAM, then storage, each one bigger but slower as you step away from the CPU.

> This guide leaves the *insides* of storage - how a hard drive, an SSD, and an NVMe drive actually differ - to a dedicated follow-up: [Storage: HDD vs SSD vs NVMe](/guides/storage-hdd-ssd-nvme). And if you want to see how the CPU and RAM cooperate while a program runs, [Processes, Memory & the CPU](/guides/processes-memory-and-cpu) picks up the software side.
