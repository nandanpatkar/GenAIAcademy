# Key Pairs, Demystified

Passwords are exhausting and a little dangerous. You have to remember them, you type the same secret to the
server every single time you log in, and anything you type can, in principle, be guessed by a machine trying
millions of combinations. SSH keys throw that model out and replace it with something that feels like magic
the first time: you log in instantly, with no password sent anywhere, and it's *more* secure, not less.

The magic is one idea. Let's install it carefully - once you have the mental model, the commands are short
and the gotcha is obvious.

## The mental model: a padlock and its only key

**What it actually is.** When you make an SSH key, you actually make a **pair** of files that belong
together:

- A **public key** - think of it as an open **padlock**. You can hand it out freely. You hang it on any
  server you want to log into.
- A **private key** - the one and only **key that opens that padlock**. It never leaves your computer. You
  never send it anywhere. Ever.

  PK["YOUR COMPUTER<br/>private key 🔑<br/>(stays here, never travels -<br/>the ONE key that opens the lock)"]
  PUB["THE SERVER<br/>your public key 🔒<br/>(a padlock you hung here -<br/>anyone can hold it; only your key opens it)"]
  PK -- prove ownership --> PUB
```

The beauty of a padlock: handing someone your padlock tells them **nothing** about your key. They can hang it
on a door, photograph it, copy it - and still can't open it. Only the matching private key can.

**Why people get this wrong.** The names sound symmetric, so beginners assume the two files are
interchangeable, or that the *public* one is the secret. It's the reverse: the public key is meant to be
shared, the **private** key is the secret you guard with your life. Mixing these up is the one mistake that
actually hurts (see the big gotcha below).

## Why this beats passwords

**What it does in real life.** When you log in with a key, the server doesn't ask for a secret you type -
instead it uses your padlock to pose a little challenge only the matching private key can answer. Your
computer answers it locally, the server sees a correct answer, and you're in. Two things follow, and they're
the whole reason keys win:

- **No secret ever travels.** With a password, you send the actual secret across the network on every login
  (encrypted, but the real thing still leaves your machine). With a key, your **private key never moves** -
  only a one-time proof does. There's no reusable secret on the wire to capture.
- **It resists brute force.** A password is short enough for a human to remember, which means it's short
  enough for a machine to eventually guess. A private key is enormous and random - far beyond what guessing
  can reach in any practical time. This is why internet-facing servers routinely turn passwords *off*.

💡 **Key point.** Passwords prove who you are by *sending a shared secret*. Keys prove who you are by
*demonstrating you hold the private key* - without revealing it. That single shift is what makes key logins
both effortless and safer.

## Generating a key with `ssh-keygen`

**What it does in real life.** One command creates the pair. The modern, recommended type is `ed25519`
(small, fast, strong). The `-C` flag just adds a comment so you can recognize the key later - your email is
the convention.

```console
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "ada@example.com"
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/ada/.ssh/id_ed25519):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/ada/.ssh/id_ed25519
Your public key has been saved in /home/ada/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:9pK2vN... ada@example.com
```

*What just happened:* `ssh-keygen` asked three questions (Enter accepts the sensible default) and wrote
**two files**:

- `id_ed25519` - your **private** key. The secret. Guard it.
- `id_ed25519.pub` - your **public** key. The `.pub` extension always marks the padlock, the shareable half.

📝 **Terminology - the passphrase.** The *passphrase* is an optional extra lock on the **private key file
itself**, so if someone copies the file off your laptop, it's still useless without it. It's *not* the
server's password - it never goes to the server. Pressing Enter twice leaves the key unprotected (convenient,
riskier); setting one is safer, and Phase 3 shows how the **ssh-agent** lets you type it just once per
session.

## `~/.ssh/` - where keys live

**What it actually is.** All of this lives in a hidden folder in your home directory called `~/.ssh/`
(the `~` means "my home folder"). Take a quick look:

```console
$ ls -l ~/.ssh
total 12
-rw-------  1 ada ada  411 Jun 19 09:14 id_ed25519
-rw-r--r--  1 ada ada   98 Jun 19 09:14 id_ed25519.pub
-rw-r--r--  1 ada ada  142 Jun 19 09:02 known_hosts
```

*What just happened:* `ls -l` listed the folder in long form: your two new key files, plus `known_hosts` from
Phase 1 (the record of servers you've trusted). Look at the leftmost column - those letters are
**permissions**, and they matter here:

- The private key reads `-rw-------`: only *you* can read or write it. No one else on the machine can even
  look.
- The public key reads `-rw-r--r--`: you can write it, everyone can read it - fine, since it's meant to be
  shared.

⚠️ **Gotcha - permissions that are too open break logins silently.** SSH is deliberately paranoid: if your
private key or `~/.ssh` folder is readable by other users, SSH **refuses to use the key** rather than risk
it being stolen. If keys mysteriously stop working, this is a prime suspect - fix with `chmod 700 ~/.ssh` and
`chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519`. (`ssh-keygen` sets these correctly when it creates the files; trouble usually
starts after copying keys around by hand.)

## Installing the public key with `ssh-copy-id`

**What it does in real life.** To log in with your key, the server needs your **padlock** - your public
key - added to a file in *its* `~/.ssh/` called `authorized_keys`. The clean way to do that is one command:

```console
$ ssh-copy-id ada@server.example.com
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
ada@server.example.com's password:

Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'ada@server.example.com'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.
```

*What just happened:* `ssh-copy-id` logged in **this one last time with your password**, appended your
public key to the server's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`, and disconnected. You just hung your padlock on the
server - from now on, your private key opens it, no password needed.

Prove it:

```console
$ ssh ada@server.example.com
Welcome to Ubuntu 24.04 LTS

ada@server:~$
```

*What just happened:* no password prompt this time. SSH offered your private key, the server checked it
against the padlock you installed, the match worked, and you were let straight in. (If you set a passphrase
on the key, you'll be asked for *that* once - Phase 3 makes even that a one-time-per-session thing.)

📝 **No `ssh-copy-id`?** On some systems (notably stock Windows) the command isn't installed. The same job
is just appending the contents of your `id_ed25519.pub` to the server's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` - any
method that gets that one line of text into that one file works. `ssh-copy-id` automates it safely.

## The one rule that matters most

⚠️ **Gotcha - NEVER share or commit your PRIVATE key.** The single most important sentence in the guide.
Your private key (`id_ed25519`, the file *without* `.pub`) is the only thing standing between you and anyone
who wants to log in as you. So:

- **Never paste it** into a chat, an email, a ticket, or a forum post.
- **Never commit it** to a Git repository - accidentally pushing a private key to GitHub is a genuinely
  common, genuinely bad mistake, and bots scan for exactly this.
- **Never copy it onto a shared machine.** Need to log in from another computer? Generate a *new* key pair
  there.

The public key (`.pub`) is the opposite - share it freely, that's its entire purpose. You can hand out as
many copies of the padlock as you like, but the key that opens it stays in your pocket, always.

## Recap

1. **A key pair = a padlock (public key) + its only key (private key).** Hand out the padlock; guard the
   key.
2. **Keys beat passwords** because no secret travels on login, and a private key is too large to brute-force.
3. **`ssh-keygen -t ed25519`** creates the pair in `~/.ssh/`: `id_ed25519` (private) and `id_ed25519.pub`
   (public).
4. **A passphrase** is an optional extra lock on the *private key file*, not the server's password.
5. **`ssh-copy-id user@host`** installs your public key on the server so future logins use the key.
6. **Never share or commit the private key.** The `.pub` file is the only half you ever hand out.

You can now log in without typing a password. Next: making SSH pleasant to live with - short names instead
of long host strings, typing your passphrase once instead of every time, and reading the errors everyone
eventually hits.
