# Ship Your Side Project to the Internet

You built something. It runs on `localhost:3000` and it works. And now there's a gap - the one nobody
warns you about - between "it works on my machine" and "a stranger can open a URL and use it." That gap
is small in concept and full of tiny, infuriating traps: billing that keeps running after you power off,
an SSH key that's "permission denied" for five different reasons, a `$` in your password that quietly
breaks everything, a login that works locally and silently fails in production.

This guide walks the **whole journey, once, end to end** - the path a real first deploy actually takes -
and flags every trap as a ⚠️ so it bites the page instead of you. We won't re-teach SSH or Docker or DNS
from scratch; each has its own guide, and we'll link them. This is the *map* that strings them together
into "my thing is live."

## How to read this
- **First deploy ever?** Read in order - it's the literal sequence you'll follow, top to bottom.
- **Stuck on one step?** Each phase is self-contained; jump to the one that's fighting you (the ⚠️
  callouts are the fixes).

## The phases
1. **[Pick a Cheap VPS](01-pick-a-vps.md)** - what specs you *actually* need, why the build needs more
   RAM than the app, and the billing trap.
2. **[SSH In With a Key](02-ssh-in-with-a-key.md)** - keys not passwords, and the "Permission denied"
   decision tree.
3. **[Docker & Your Private Repo](03-docker-and-your-repo.md)** - install Docker, get a *private* repo
   onto the box with a deploy key, `compose up`.
4. **[Domains & DNS](04-domains-and-dns.md)** - buy one, point it, apex vs www, and the `.dev` HTTPS trap.
5. **[Behind Cloudflare](05-behind-cloudflare.md)** - free HTTPS, no open ports, and the cookie/CSRF
   must-dos that break logins.
6. **[Auto-Deploy on Merge](06-auto-deploy-on-merge.md)** - merge to `main`, and it's live.
