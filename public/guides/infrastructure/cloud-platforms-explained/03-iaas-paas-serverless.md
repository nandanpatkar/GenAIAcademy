# IaaS vs PaaS vs Serverless, and Staying Sane

There's one more dimension to the building blocks, and it quietly shapes every cloud decision: *how much
of the work do you want to do yourself?* The same outcome - "run my code" - can be bought at several
levels of done-for-you, from "here's a bare machine, you handle everything" to "here's a place to paste a
function, we handle the rest." This phase gives you that spectrum, then names the three things that turn
an otherwise fine cloud setup into a bad week - and how to defuse each before it bites.

## The spectrum: IaaS → PaaS → Serverless

It's one dial, not three separate worlds. As you slide toward "more managed," you do *less operations
work* - and you also get *less control* and bind yourself a little tighter to the provider. Nothing here
is "better"; they're trades.

### IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service (the raw VM)

The provider gives you the machine; everything *on* it is yours. You pick the OS, install the runtime,
configure the web server, set up deploys, and keep it patched. This is EC2 / Compute Engine / Azure VMs
from Phase 2. **The trade:** maximum control and flexibility - it's just a computer, you can do anything -
in exchange for maximum operational work. You are the sysadmin.

### PaaS - Platform as a Service (a place to run your app)

You hand the platform your *application code* and a little configuration; it provides the operating
system, the language runtime, the scaling, and the deploy mechanics. You stop thinking about the machine
and think only about your app.

📝 **PaaS.** A managed platform that runs your application for you. You provide code; the provider
provides and operates everything underneath it (OS, runtime, scaling). Examples: AWS Elastic Beanstalk,
GCP App Engine, Azure App Service.

**The trade:** far less ops work than IaaS, at the cost of fitting the platform's expectations (its
supported runtimes, its way of deploying, its limits). You give up some control to stop being a sysadmin.

### Serverless - functions that run on demand (FaaS)

You upload a single function. The provider runs it *only when something triggers it* - an HTTP request, a
file landing in a bucket, a scheduled timer - and you pay only for the time it actually runs. There's no
machine to manage, and when nothing's calling it, nothing's running. "Serverless" doesn't mean no
servers; it means *you* never see, size, or manage them.

📝 **Serverless / FaaS (Functions as a Service).** You deploy a function, not a machine. The provider
runs it on demand, scales it from zero to many automatically, and bills per execution. Examples: AWS
Lambda, GCP Cloud Functions, Azure Functions.

**The trade:** the least ops work of all, and you pay nothing while idle - wonderful for spiky or
occasional workloads. In exchange you accept the platform's constraints (time limits, a "cold start"
delay after idle, limited execution environments) and the *deepest* coupling to that provider's way of
doing things.

💡 **Key point.** Read the dial as: *more managed = less control + less ops + tighter coupling.* There's
no universally right spot. A team that wants to tune everything leans IaaS; a team that wants to ship and
not babysit leans PaaS or serverless. Most real systems mix all three.

## Staying sane: the three gotchas that actually hurt

The platforms work. What ruins people's weeks isn't the technology failing - it's three predictable
traps, named here before they bite, with the calm move for each.

### Gotcha 1 - Surprise bills (the meter you forgot)

⚠️ **This is the one that ends up in horror stories.** Because pricing is metered (Phase 1), anything
left running bills you silently: a beefy machine spun up "just to test" and never shut down; a managed
database sized for launch-day traffic nobody scaled back; a misconfigured job that loops and re-runs; or
data egressing to the internet (outbound network transfer is often charged, and it surprises people). No
alarm sounds - the invoice just arrives.

**The calm move: set a budget with alerts before you do anything else.** Every provider lets you define a
spending threshold and get emailed (or paged) when you approach it - the single highest-value ten minutes
in any new cloud account.

```console
$ aws budgets create-budget --account-id 123456789012 \
    --budget '{"BudgetName":"monthly-cap","BudgetLimit":{"Amount":"50","Unit":"USD"},"TimeUnit":"MONTHLY","BudgetType":"COST"}' \
    --notifications-with-subscribers '[{"Notification":{"NotificationType":"ACTUAL","ComparisonOperator":"GREATER_THAN","Threshold":80},"Subscribers":[{"SubscriptionType":"EMAIL","Address":"you@example.com"}]}]'
```
*What just happened:* You created a monthly budget called `monthly-cap` and told AWS to email you the
moment your *actual* spend crosses 80% of it - turning a silent meter into one that taps you on the
shoulder early, while a mistake is still cheap to fix. (GCP and Azure have the same feature: GCP "Budgets
& alerts," Azure "Cost Management budgets.")

📝 **A budget alerts you; it does not stop spending.** The cloud won't auto-stop your resources at $50 -
it just emails you. Stopping the spend is still your action. Treat the alert as a smoke detector, not a
circuit breaker.

### Gotcha 2 - IAM complexity (permissions that grow into a swamp)

**Why it bites.** IAM (Phase 2) starts simple and compounds. Each new service needs permission to talk to
the others, and the path of least resistance when something is denied is to grant broad, sweeping access
"to make it work." Do that a few dozen times and half the identities can do almost anything, nobody
remembers why, and a single leaked credential is a catastrophe instead of a contained incident.

**The calm move: least privilege, on purpose.** Grant each identity the *specific* permissions its job
needs and no more. When you hit an "access denied," resist widening the door - read what was actually
denied and grant exactly that. Slower in the moment, dramatically safer over the life of the system.

📝 **Least privilege.** The principle of giving each identity (person or code) only the permissions it
genuinely needs. The opposite - "just give it admin" - is the most common and most dangerous IAM
shortcut.

🪖 **War story shape.** The breaches you read about are rarely "the hacker defeated the cloud" - far more
often "a key with too many permissions leaked, and because it could touch everything, so could whoever
found it." Over-permissioning turns a small leak into a big one. That's why this gotcha is worth the
friction.

### Gotcha 3 - Lock-in (the exit you didn't plan)

The more managed and provider-specific the services you build on, the harder it is to ever leave that
provider. Build everything on plain VMs and a standard PostgreSQL database, and you could move to another
cloud (or your own servers) with effort but no rewrite. Build deeply on one provider's proprietary
serverless triggers, managed queues, and specialized databases, and your application is woven into *that*
provider - moving means rewriting.

**The honest framing: lock-in is a trade, not a sin.** Those deeply-managed, provider-specific services
are often genuinely the most productive way to ship. The mistake isn't using them; it's using them
*without knowing you're making the trade.* Decide deliberately how much portability this system is worth.

**The calm move: keep the expensive-to-move parts portable, and manage it all as code.** Your data and
core application logic are the painful things to migrate, so favor standard, portable choices there (a
normal SQL database over a proprietary one, your own code over platform-specific glue) where it matters.
Describe your whole setup in **infrastructure as code** so it's reproducible and reviewable, not a pile
of hand-clicked console settings nobody can recreate.

> ⏭️ That last point deserves its own skill. Defining your cloud resources in version-controlled files -
> so the whole environment can be rebuilt, reviewed, and (partly) re-pointed at another provider - is
> exactly what [Infrastructure as Code with Terraform](/guides/infrastructure-as-code-terraform)
> teaches. It's the antidote to both "what did we even click to set this up?" and the worst of lock-in.

## Recap

1. **IaaS → PaaS → Serverless is one dial:** more managed means less ops work, less control, and tighter
   coupling. Pick a spot per workload; most systems mix all three.
2. **Surprise bills:** the meter runs on anything left on. Set a **budget with alerts** first - but know
   it warns, it doesn't stop.
3. **IAM complexity:** grant **least privilege** on purpose; resist widening permissions "to make it
   work," because over-permissioning is how small leaks become big breaches.
4. **Lock-in:** it's a deliberate trade, not a sin - keep your data and core logic portable where it
   matters, and define everything as code.

You now have the whole mental model: what the cloud sells, the blocks it's made of, and how to choose
among them without getting burned. Next: stop clicking the console and start describing your
infrastructure as code, so it's reproducible, reviewable, and yours.
