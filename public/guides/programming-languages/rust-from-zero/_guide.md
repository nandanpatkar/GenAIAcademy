# Rust From Zero

Rust has a reputation that sounds like a contradiction: it's as fast as C, but it won't let you corrupt
memory or crash on a stray pointer - and it proves that *at compile time*, before your program ever runs.
For years languages made you pick: fast and dangerous, or safe and slow. Rust's whole reason for existing
is to refuse that trade.

There's a second part to Rust's reputation, and it's also true: the learning curve is steep. The compiler
will reject programs that *look* perfectly fine, with errors about "borrows" and "moves" and "lifetimes"
that mean nothing to you yet. That's not you being bad at this. It's a genuinely new idea - **ownership** -
that no mainstream language before Rust made you think about directly. Everyone hits this wall. The good
news: it's one idea, it's learnable, and once it clicks, the compiler stops feeling like an enemy and
starts feeling like a coworker who catches your bugs before they ship.

This guide takes you the whole way: from "I've never written a line of Rust" to understanding what the
language is *actually doing* - ownership, yes, but also lifetimes, traits, smart pointers, concurrency,
and the parts of Rust that make it fast. We go mental-model-first the whole way: before any command,
you'll understand what the thing actually *is* and why Rust made the choice it did.

It's one zero-to-hero journey in two halves. **Phases 1–9 are the basics** - enough to read real Rust,
structure a project, and reason about ownership instead of guessing. **Phases 10–17 are the deep half** -
lifetimes, traits and generics, smart pointers, error handling, fearless concurrency, iterators, macros,
and performance and unsafe, the stuff that separates "writes Rust" from "understands Rust." Each phase
carries a difficulty badge so you can see the climb.

If you've never programmed at all, start with a gentler on-ramp first -
[Programming From Zero](/guides/programming-from-zero) - then come back here. Rust is a hard *first*
language; it's a great *second* one.

## How to read this

- **Brand new to Rust? Read 1–9 in order.** Each phase builds on the last. Phases 1–5 give you the
  language and how to organize it. Then phase 6 - ownership - is the whole game. Come back for 10+ when
  the basics feel comfortable.
- **Already know another language?** Skim phases 1–5 to catch where Rust is *deliberately different*
  (immutable by default, no `null`, exhaustive `match`, expressions everywhere), then **really slow down
  at phase 6.** Ownership is where Rust stops looking like a normal language and starts being Rust.
- **Past the basics already?** Jump to the deep half - [Phase 10: Lifetimes & the Borrow
  Checker](10-lifetimes-and-borrowing.md) onward is where ownership grows up into lifetimes, traits, and
  the zero-cost abstractions that make Rust fast.

## The phases

**Part 1 - The basics (🟢 Basic → 🟡 Intermediate)**
1. **[Install & Your First Program](01-install-and-first-program.md)** 🟢 - `rustup`, and `cargo run` (not raw `rustc`).
2. **[Syntax, Values & Types](02-syntax-values-and-types.md)** 🟢 - immutable by default, static types with inference, shadowing.
3. **[Collections](03-collections.md)** 🟢 - `Vec<T>`, arrays, the `String` vs `&str` confusion, `HashMap`.
4. **[Control Flow & Functions](04-control-flow-and-functions.md)** 🟢 - `if`/`match` as expressions, the loops, exhaustive matching.
5. **[Modules & Project Layout](05-modules-and-project-layout.md)** 🟢 - `Cargo.toml`, `main.rs`/`lib.rs`, `mod`/`pub`/`use`, crates.
6. **[Ownership & Borrowing](06-ownership-and-borrowing.md)** 🟡 - **the whole point of Rust:** owning, moving, borrowing, and the borrow checker.
7. **[Errors & I/O](07-errors-and-io.md)** 🟡 - `Result`/`Option` instead of exceptions and `null`, the `?` operator, files.
8. **[Ecosystem & Tooling](08-ecosystem-and-tooling.md)** 🟡 - `cargo test`, `cargo fmt`, `clippy`, crates, the toolchain you get free.
9. **[Idioms & Gotchas](09-idioms-and-gotchas.md)** 🟡 - how Rust programmers actually write Rust, and the traps that bite everyone once.

**Part 2 - Beyond the basics (🔴 Advanced)**
10. **[Lifetimes & the Borrow Checker, Deep](10-lifetimes-and-borrowing.md)** 🔴 - what lifetime annotations mean, elision, and references in structs.
11. **[Traits & Generics, Deep](11-traits-and-generics.md)** 🔴 - trait bounds, associated types, `impl` vs `dyn`, static vs dynamic dispatch.
12. **[Smart Pointers & Interior Mutability](12-smart-pointers.md)** 🔴 - `Box`, `Rc`/`Arc`, `RefCell`/`Cell`, `Deref` and `Drop`.
13. **[Error Handling, Deep](13-error-handling-deep.md)** 🟡 - `?` in depth, custom error types, `thiserror`/`anyhow`, `Option` combinators.
14. **[Fearless Concurrency](14-fearless-concurrency.md)** 🔴 - threads, `Send`/`Sync`, `Arc<Mutex<T>>`, channels, and a taste of `async`.
15. **[Closures, Iterators & Zero-Cost Abstractions](15-closures-and-iterators.md)** 🟡 - `Fn`/`FnMut`/`FnOnce`, iterator adapters, free speed.
16. **[Macros & Metaprogramming](16-macros.md)** 🟡 - `macro_rules!`, `derive`, and what procedural macros are for.
17. **[Performance, Unsafe & the Ecosystem](17-performance-and-unsafe.md)** 🔴 - zero-cost abstractions, when `unsafe` is justified, profiling, key crates.

**Finale**
18. **[Where to Go Next](18-where-to-go-next.md)** 🟢 - CLIs, web, systems, WebAssembly, and what to actually build.

> Frameworks and big domains (`async` runtimes, embedded, WebAssembly toolchains) are their own world -
> this guide makes the *language* make sense, top to bottom.
