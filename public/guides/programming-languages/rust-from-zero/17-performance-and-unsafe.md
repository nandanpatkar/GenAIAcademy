# Performance, Unsafe & the Ecosystem - The Last Mile

You've come a long way. You can model data with enums, wrangle the borrow checker, write your own traits and macros. This phase is the last mile of the deep half - the practical knowledge that separates "I can write Rust" from "I can ship Rust." We'll cover why your code is probably already fast, the one switch that makes it *dramatically* faster, how to measure instead of guess, what the scary-sounding `unsafe` keyword actually means, and the handful of crates you'll lean on every day.

The throughline: Rust gives you control without making you pay for ceremony you don't use.

## Rust is fast by default

**What's actually going on.** Rust has no garbage collector pausing your program to clean up, and no runtime interpreting your code - it compiles straight to native machine code, like C and C++. On top of that, the abstractions you've used all guide are **zero-cost** (from [Phase 15](15-closures-and-iterators.md)): an iterator chain, a `match`, an `Option` - they compile down to the same instructions you'd write by hand, with nothing extra at runtime.

```rust
fn main() {
    let nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

    // Reads like a high-level pipeline...
    let total: i32 = nums.iter().filter(|&&n| n % 2 == 0).map(|&n| n * n).sum();

    println!("{}", total); // 4 + 16 + 36
}
```
```console
$ cargo run
56
```
*What just happened:* That `.iter().filter().map().sum()` chain looks like it allocates intermediate collections and walks the data several times. It doesn't - the compiler fuses the whole thing into a single tight loop with no heap allocation, byte-for-byte what a hand-written `for` loop would produce. You get the readable version *and* the fast version at once.

💡 **Key insight.** Most Rust is fast without you trying. The ownership system, the lack of a GC, and zero-cost abstractions mean idiomatic code is usually already efficient. Your job is rarely "make this faster" from scratch - it's "don't accidentally make it slow" and "find the one spot that actually matters." Which brings us to the switch everyone forgets.

## The one switch everyone forgets: `--release`

This is the single most common Rust performance mistake, and it bites beginners and experienced developers alike. By default, `cargo run` and `cargo build` produce a **debug build**, tuned for fast *compilation* and good *debugging*, not fast *execution*: optimizations are off, and extra runtime checks (like the integer-overflow panic from [Phase 9](09-idioms-and-gotchas.md)) are on.

⚠️ **Gotcha - never benchmark or ship a debug build.** A debug build can be *ten to a hundred times slower* than a release build for compute-heavy code. People regularly conclude "Rust is slow" after timing a debug binary. The fix is one flag.

```console
$ cargo run                 # debug: slow, with overflow checks
$ cargo run --release       # optimized: this is the real speed
$ cargo build --release     # binary lands in target/release/
```

To make the gap concrete, imagine timing a number-crunching loop both ways:

```console
$ cargo run --quiet -- crunch
debug build:    8.42s

$ cargo run --release --quiet -- crunch
release build:  0.11s
```
*What just happened:* The exact same code, the same input - the only difference is `--release`. The optimizer inlined functions, unrolled loops, and dropped the debug-only checks, turning eight seconds into a tenth of one. (These numbers are illustrative; the actual factor depends on your machine and code. The lesson - *debug is for developing, release is for measuring and shipping* - holds everywhere.)

Develop and test with plain `cargo`, but the moment you care about speed - benchmarking, profiling, or handing a binary to a user - reach for `--release`.

## Measure, then optimize

Once you're on a release build, the next rule is older than Rust: **don't guess where the time goes - measure.** Programmers are famously bad at predicting hotspots. You'll spend an afternoon shaving nanoseconds off a function that runs twice, while the real cost hides in a loop you never suspected.

The biggest wins almost never come from micro-tweaks. They come from **algorithmic cost** - the difference between an approach that scales gracefully and one that falls off a cliff as data grows. The classic example: scanning a list to look things up (`O(n)` per lookup, `O(n²)` in a loop) versus a `HashMap` (`O(1)` per lookup).

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {
    let prices = vec![("apple", 3), ("pear", 5), ("plum", 2)];
    let orders = ["pear", "apple", "pear", "plum", "apple"];

    // Slow path: for each order, scan the whole list to find its price → O(n*m).
    // Fast path: build a HashMap once, then every lookup is ~O(1).
    let lookup: HashMap<&str, i32> = prices.into_iter().collect();

    let total: i32 = orders.iter().map(|name| lookup[name]).sum();
    println!("{}", total); // 5 + 3 + 5 + 2 + 3
}
```
```console
$ cargo run --release
18
```
*What just happened:* We paid a one-time cost to build a `HashMap` from the price list, and every lookup became near-instant regardless of how many products exist. With the scan-the-list approach, doubling the product count *and* order count roughly quadruples the work; with the `HashMap`, it barely moves. No amount of micro-optimizing the slow version would ever catch up - the algorithm dominates.

If big-O notation feels fuzzy, this is worth internalizing before you tune anything: [the cost of an algorithm, without the math panic](/guides/big-o-without-the-math-panic). Play with how different growth rates diverge as input scales:

```playground-bigo
```

**Once the algorithm is sound, *then* reach for the profilers.** Rust has excellent tooling for finding real hotspots:

- **`criterion`** - a benchmarking crate that runs your code many times, accounts for noise, and gives statistically trustworthy numbers (far better than a hand-rolled timer).
- **`cargo flamegraph`** - generates a flame graph showing which functions eat the most time across a whole run. The widest bars are where to look.
- **`perf`** (Linux) - the low-level system profiler `cargo flamegraph` builds on; reach for it for fine-grained CPU data.

💡 **Key insight.** Profile *before* you optimize, and again *after*. The measurement tells you where to spend effort and proves your change helped. Optimizing without measuring is how you make code uglier and no faster.

## `unsafe` - what it really is

The word `unsafe` scares people away, and the fear is mostly a misunderstanding.

📝 **`unsafe`** - a keyword that unlocks five specific abilities the compiler can't verify for you. It does **not** turn off the borrow checker, and does **not** mean "dangerous code lives here." Inside an `unsafe` block, ownership, borrowing, and lifetime rules all still apply exactly as before. What changes is that *you* take responsibility for upholding a handful of invariants the compiler normally checks - because in these specific cases, it can't.

The five superpowers `unsafe` grants, and nothing more:

1. Dereference a **raw pointer** (`*const T` / `*mut T`).
2. Call a function marked `unsafe` (including foreign C functions via FFI).
3. Access or modify a **mutable `static`** variable.
4. Implement an `unsafe` trait.
5. Access the fields of a **`union`**.

**Why it exists.** Some things are genuinely safe but impossible for the compiler to *prove* safe. Talking to a C library (FFI) means calling code the borrow checker can't see. A high-performance data structure - a custom allocator, a lock-free queue - sometimes needs raw pointers. `unsafe` is the escape hatch for "I know this is correct; trust me and let me do it."

Here's the canonical tiny example - dereferencing a raw pointer:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 42;
    let ptr = &x as *const i32; // make a raw pointer (this part is safe)

    // Dereferencing it requires unsafe: the compiler can't guarantee
    // the pointer is still valid, so YOU promise that it is.
    let value = unsafe { *ptr };

    println!("{}", value);
}
```
```console
$ cargo run
42
```
*What just happened:* Creating the raw pointer `ptr` is allowed in safe code - it's just an address. *Reading through it* with `*ptr` needs `unsafe`, because a raw pointer carries no lifetime, so the compiler can't prove it still points at valid memory. Wrapping the deref in `unsafe` is you signing off: "I've verified `x` is alive and this address is good."

⚠️ **Gotcha - keep `unsafe` tiny and wrap it.** The discipline that makes `unsafe` manageable: make the block as small as possible, uphold the invariants right there, and expose a **safe** function around it so callers never touch `unsafe` themselves. This is exactly how the standard library works - `Vec`, `HashMap`, and friends use `unsafe` internally but present a fully safe API. Most application code never writes `unsafe` at all; it's a tool for library authors and FFI, not a daily driver.

## The ecosystem: crates worth knowing by name

Rust's standard library is deliberately small - it gives you the language essentials and leaves the rest to **crates.io**, the central package registry you pull from with `cargo add` (from [Phase 8](08-ecosystem-and-tooling.md)). The ecosystem is one of Rust's real strengths, and a handful of crates show up in nearly every serious project:

| Crate | What it does | When you reach for it |
|---|---|---|
| **`serde`** | Serialization framework | Converting structs to/from JSON, TOML, etc. The backbone of almost all Rust data handling. |
| **`tokio`** | Async runtime | Anything network- or IO-heavy: servers, clients, concurrent tasks. The de facto async standard. |
| **`rayon`** | Data parallelism | Turn a sequential iterator parallel by changing `.iter()` to `.par_iter()`. Effortless multi-core. |
| **`clap`** | Command-line arg parsing | Building any CLI tool - flags, subcommands, help text, all derived from a struct. |
| **`reqwest`** | HTTP client | Making HTTP requests (calling an API, fetching a URL) without hand-rolling sockets. |
| **`anyhow` / `thiserror`** | Error handling | The error ergonomics from [Phase 13](13-error-handling-deep.md): `anyhow` for applications, `thiserror` for libraries. |

💡 **Key insight.** Before writing your own serializer, argument parser, or HTTP client, check crates.io - there's almost certainly a well-maintained, battle-tested crate that does it better than a from-scratch version. Look for recent updates, lots of downloads, and good docs (every crate's docs live at `docs.rs`). Standing on the ecosystem's shoulders is idiomatic Rust, not a shortcut.

And with that, the deep half closes. You now understand Rust from `cargo run` down to `unsafe` - the type system, ownership, traits, generics, error handling, async, macros, and now performance and the ecosystem. What's left is knowing where to point it.

## Recap

1. **Rust is fast by default** - no GC, no runtime, native code, and zero-cost abstractions mean idiomatic code is usually already efficient. Your job is mostly to *not* make it slow.
2. **Always use `--release` for real speed.** Debug builds are far slower (no optimization, extra checks). Never benchmark or ship a debug binary - `cargo run --release` / `cargo build --release`.
3. **Measure, then optimize.** Algorithmic cost (an `O(1)` `HashMap` vs an `O(n²)` scan) dominates micro-tweaks. Use `criterion` to benchmark, `cargo flamegraph`/`perf` to find hotspots, and profile before *and* after.
4. **`unsafe` is narrow, not scary.** It doesn't disable the borrow checker - it unlocks five specific powers (raw-pointer deref, unsafe fn calls, mutable statics, unsafe traits, union fields) where you uphold invariants the compiler can't. Keep blocks tiny and wrap them in safe APIs.
5. **Lean on the ecosystem.** `serde`, `tokio`, `rayon`, `clap`, `reqwest`, `anyhow`/`thiserror` are the daily-drivers. Reach for a well-maintained crate before rolling your own.

    "choices": [
      "Switch from scanning the list (O(n) per lookup) to a HashMap (≈O(1) per lookup) - fix the algorithm",
      "Manually unroll the loop to save a few instructions per iteration",

      "Convert the loop to use shorter variable names so it compiles faster"
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explain": "Algorithmic cost dominates micro-optimizations. Repeatedly scanning a list is O(n) per lookup (O(n²) overall); a HashMap makes each lookup ≈O(1). Changing the data structure beats any amount of low-level tweaking on the slow version. Measure first, then fix the algorithm."
