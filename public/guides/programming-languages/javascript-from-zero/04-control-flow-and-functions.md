# Control Flow & Functions

So far your code runs straight down, every line, once. Real programs need to *choose* (do this only if
that's true), *repeat* (do this for every item), and *reuse* behavior without copy-pasting. Those three
needs - decisions, loops, and functions - are this phase. Functions especially: the unit you'll think in
for the rest of your career.

## Making decisions: `if` / `else`

`if` runs a block of code only when a condition is `true`; `else` covers the other case.
```javascript runnable
const hour = 14;

if (hour < 12) {
  console.log("Good morning");
} else if (hour < 18) {
  console.log("Good afternoon");
} else {
  console.log("Good evening");
}
```
```console
Good afternoon
```
*What just happened:* JavaScript checked the conditions top to bottom. `hour < 12` was `false` (14 isn't
less than 12), so it moved on; `hour < 18` was `true`, so it ran *that* block and skipped the rest. The
first matching branch wins - `{ }` braces group the lines in each branch.

Here's that decision as a picture:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A{hour < 12?} -->|yes| M[Good morning]
  A -->|no| B{hour < 18?}
  B -->|yes| AF[Good afternoon]
  B -->|no| E[Good evening]
```

📝 **Terminology - truthy and falsy.** Conditions don't have to be literal `true`/`false` - JavaScript
treats some values as "truthy," others "falsy," in a yes/no context. Falsy values are worth memorizing
since they're a common source of bugs: `false`, `0`, `""` (empty string), `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`.
*Everything else* is truthy - including `"0"` (a non-empty string) and `[]` (an empty array). So
`if (value)` means "if value is truthy."

## Repeating: `for...of` and `while`

The cleanest way to do something with every item in an array is `for...of`:
```javascript runnable
const names = ["Ada", "Linus", "Grace"];
for (const name of names) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}`);
}
```
```console
Hello, Ada
Hello, Linus
Hello, Grace
```
*What just happened:* `for (const name of names)` walked `names`, putting each item into `name` and
running the block - no index counter to manage. (You'll also see the older C-style
`for (let i = 0; i < names.length; i++)` loop; `for...of` is cleaner when you don't need the index.)

When you don't know how many times to loop in advance, use `while` - it repeats *as long as* its
condition stays true:
```javascript runnable
let countdown = 3;
while (countdown > 0) {
  console.log(countdown);
  countdown = countdown - 1;
}
console.log("Liftoff!");
```
```console
3
2
1
Liftoff!
```
*What just happened:* `while` checked `countdown > 0`, ran the block, and checked again, repeating until
`countdown` hit `0`. Crucially, the block *changes* `countdown` each time. ⚠️ A `while` loop whose
condition never becomes false (you forget to change the thing it checks) runs forever and freezes your
program - the classic "infinite loop." Make sure each pass moves toward the exit.

## Functions: naming a block of behavior

A function is a named, reusable block of instructions taking *inputs* (parameters) and handing back an
*output* (a return value) - write behavior once, run it whenever you need it, with different inputs.
```javascript runnable
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("Ada"));
console.log(greet("Grace"));
```
```console
Hello, Ada!
Hello, Grace!
```
*What just happened:* `function greet(name) { ... }` defined a function with one **parameter**, `name`.
`return` hands a value back to the caller. `greet("Ada")` produced `"Hello, Ada!"`; same function, called
twice with different inputs, gave two different outputs - the whole point of parameters.

📝 **Terminology.** A **parameter** is the name in the function definition (`name`); an **argument** is
the value passed in when calling (`"Ada"`). `return` ends the function and sends a value back; a function
with no `return` hands back `undefined`.

**Default parameters** let a parameter fall back to a value if the caller leaves it out:
```javascript runnable
function greet(name = "friend") {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
console.log(greet());          // no argument passed
console.log(greet("Ada"));
```
```console
Hello, friend!
Hello, Ada!
```
*What just happened:* Calling `greet()` with no argument let `name` fall back to its default, `"friend"`;
passing `"Ada"` overrode it. Defaults save you from scattering "if it wasn't provided, use X" checks
through your code.

## Arrow functions: the compact form

You've already seen these in [Phase 3](03-collections.md). An **arrow function** is a shorter way to
write a function, used constantly for small inline functions:
```javascript runnable
const double = (n) => n * 2;
const greet = (name) => `Hello, ${name}!`;

console.log(double(5));
console.log(greet("Ada"));
```
```console
10
Hello, Ada!
```
*What just happened:* `(n) => n * 2` is a function taking `n` and returning `n * 2`. A single-expression
body skips the `{ }` and the word `return` - the value returns automatically. Same idea as a `function`,
written tighter. For a multi-line body, bring back the braces and an explicit `return`:
`(n) => { const r = n * 2; return r; }`.

For now, treat arrow functions and `function` declarations as two ways to write the same thing. One real
behavioral difference around `this` is flagged at the end of this phase and covered fully later.

## Functions are values you can pass around

The idea that makes JavaScript click: **a function is itself a value** - you can store it in a variable,
put it in an array, and (the powerful part) *pass it to another function*. A function passed to another
function is called a **callback**.
```javascript runnable
function runTwice(action) {
  action();
  action();
}

runTwice(() => console.log("tick"));
```
```console
tick
tick
```
*What just happened:* `runTwice` takes a function as its argument and calls it twice. We handed it
`() => console.log("tick")`, and it ran twice. This is exactly what `map`/`filter`/`reduce` do: hand them
a function, and *they* decide when and how to call it on your data. Once this feels natural, huge swaths
of JavaScript (event handlers, array methods, async code) stop looking like magic.

💡 **Key point.** "First-class functions" is the formal name for this: functions are values, equal
citizens with numbers and strings. Passing behavior into other code, not just data, is the backbone of
how JavaScript handles clicks, timers, and network responses - all coming in
[Phase 6](06-async-and-the-dom.md).

## ⚠️ A tease: `this` depends on *how* you call a function

You'll eventually meet the keyword `this` inside functions - one of JavaScript's genuinely confusing
corners. The sentence that defuses most of the pain: **`this` is not set by where a function is
*defined*, but by *how it is called*.** The same function sees a different `this` depending on whether
you call it as a method, on its own, or as a callback. Arrow functions don't get their own `this` - one
reason people prefer them for callbacks.

That's all for now; the full mental model gets its own treatment in
[Phase 9: Idioms & Gotchas](09-idioms-and-gotchas.md).

## Recap

1. **`if` / `else if` / `else`** picks the first branch whose condition is truthy; remember the falsy
   values (`false`, `0`, `""`, `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`).
2. **`for...of`** loops over each item in a list cleanly; **`while`** repeats until its condition goes
   false - make sure it eventually does.
3. **Functions** package reusable behavior: **parameters** are inputs, `return` is the output, and
   **defaults** cover missing arguments.
4. **Arrow functions** (`(n) => n * 2`) are the compact form for small inline functions.
5. **Functions are values** - you can pass them around; one passed into another function is a
   **callback**. And `this` is decided by *how* a function is called, not where it's written.

Next: modules, which let you split a program across files and pull the pieces together cleanly.
