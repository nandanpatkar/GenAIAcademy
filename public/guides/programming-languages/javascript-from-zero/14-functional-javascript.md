# Functional JavaScript - Functions as Building Blocks

You already use functional JavaScript without naming it: every time you wrote `nums.map(n => n * 2)` back in [Phase 9](09-idioms-and-gotchas.md), you handed one function to another. That move is the seed the whole functional style grows from - a *way of thinking*: build programs from small, honest functions and snap them together, for code you can test in isolation, reason about without tracing the whole program, and change without fear. Five ideas carry the weight: functions as values, purity, higher-order functions, immutability, and composition. Each builds on the last.

## Functions are first-class values

**What it actually is.** In JavaScript a function is an ordinary value: store it in a variable, put it in an array, pass it as an argument, return it from another function. Everything else in this phase follows from that.

📝 **First-class value** - something the language lets you store in a variable, pass as an argument, and return from a function. Functions qualify in JavaScript; that's what "functions are first-class" means.

```javascript runnable
const double = (n) => n * 2;        // store a function in a variable
const ops = [double, (n) => n + 1]; // put functions in an array

function applyAll(value, fns) {     // accept functions as an argument
  return fns.map((fn) => fn(value));
}

console.log(double(5));
console.log(applyAll(10, ops));
```
```console
10
[ 20, 11 ]
```
*What just happened:* `double` is a function living in a variable, no different from `const x = 5`. Nothing here is special syntax - we're treating functions as plain values, and passing/returning them is the foundation the next four sections stand on.

## Pure functions

The most valuable function you can write is one that's *boring and predictable* - a **pure function**.

📝 **Pure function** - a function that (1) returns the same output for the same input, every time, and (2) has no side effects: it doesn't change anything outside itself (no mutating shared variables, no writing to the page, no network calls, no `console.log`). Give it `2` and `3`, it gives back `5` - today, tomorrow, on any machine.

**Why this matters.** A pure function is a closed box: to understand it you only read *it*. Test it with nothing but inputs and expected outputs - no setup, no mocks, no database - and it can never surprise a caller by quietly editing something elsewhere. Impure functions depend on or alter the world around them, so understanding one means understanding everything it touches.

```javascript runnable
// PURE: output depends only on inputs; nothing outside changes.
function addPure(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// IMPURE: reads and writes a shared variable outside itself.
let total = 0;
function addImpure(n) {
  total += n;          // side effect: mutates outer state
  return total;        // output depends on history, not just input
}

console.log(addPure(2, 3), addPure(2, 3)); // same input -> same output
console.log(addImpure(5), addImpure(5));   // same input -> DIFFERENT output
```
```console
5 5
5 10
```
*What just happened:* `addPure(2, 3)` returned `5` both times - same inputs, same answer, forever. `addImpure(5)` returned `5` then `10`, because it secretly leans on and mutates `total`. Same input, different output: the hallmark of an impure function, and why it's harder to test and trust.

💡 **Push side effects to the edges.** You can't avoid them entirely - a real program must eventually read input, draw to the screen, or save a file. The functional move is to *concentrate* them: keep a large core of pure functions that compute results, and do the messy I/O in a thin shell at the boundary.

## Higher-order functions

Once functions are values, a natural superpower appears: functions that take or return *other* functions.

📝 **Higher-order function** - a function that takes a function as an argument, or returns one. `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` from Phase 9 all take a function. Here you'll also build one that *returns* a function.

A function that returns a function is a **factory**: give it some configuration and it hands back a brand-new, specialized function with that configuration baked in.

```javascript runnable
// A factory: returns a NEW function specialized by `factor`.
function multiplyBy(factor) {
  return (n) => n * factor;   // the returned function remembers `factor`
}

const triple = multiplyBy(3);
const tenfold = multiplyBy(10);

console.log(triple(5));
console.log(tenfold(5));
console.log([1, 2, 3].map(multiplyBy(2))); // hand the new function to map
```
```console
15
50
[ 2, 4, 6 ]
```
*What just happened:* `multiplyBy(3)` *returned a function* - one that multiplies by 3 because it remembers `factor` from the call that created it (a closure, from [Phase 10](10-scope-and-closures.md)). The last line shows why this is useful: `multiplyBy(2)` produces exactly the single-argument function `map` wants, built on the spot and handed straight over.

Returning functions also lets you *wrap* behavior. A logging wrapper takes any function and returns a new one that does the same job, plus logs:

```javascript runnable
function withLogging(fn) {
  return (...args) => {              // rest gathers all arguments (Phase 9)
    console.log("calling with:", args);
    const result = fn(...args);      // spread them back in
    console.log("got:", result);
    return result;
  };
}

const add = (a, b) => a + b;
const loudAdd = withLogging(add);
loudAdd(2, 3);
```
```console
calling with: [ 2, 3 ]
got: 5
```
*What just happened:* `withLogging` returned a *new* function that wraps the original - printing before and after - without `add` itself ever changing. This "take a function, return an enhanced function" pattern is the heart of decorators, middleware, and a lot of library design.

## Immutability - don't mutate, return new data

Back in Phase 9 you met the reference trap: objects and arrays are held by *reference*, so two variables can point at the same object and a change through one is visible through the other. **Immutability** defuses that trap: instead of changing data in place, you produce *new* data and leave the original untouched.

📝 **Immutability** - treating data as read-only. Rather than mutating an array or object (`push`, `splice`, `obj.x = ...`), build a new one (`map`, `filter`, spread `...`) and leave the original alone.

**Why bother.** Shared mutable state causes an enormous share of bugs: when any part of the program can reach in and change an object another part relies on, behavior depends on *who ran when*. If data never changes out from under you, a whole category of "why did this value change?!" bugs can't happen. (Pure functions and immutability are siblings: a pure function won't mutate its inputs, so it naturally produces new data.)

Here's the trap and the fix side by side:

```javascript runnable
const original = [1, 2, 3];

// MUTATING approach: push changes `original` in place.
function addItemBad(arr, item) {
  arr.push(item);   // mutates the array passed in!
  return arr;
}

const bad = addItemBad(original, 4);
console.log("after bad:", original); // original was modified - surprise

// IMMUTABLE approach: build a new array, leave the input alone.
const fresh = [10, 20, 30];
function addItemGood(arr, item) {
  return [...arr, item]; // new array; arr is untouched
}

const good = addItemGood(fresh, 40);
console.log("fresh stays:", fresh);
console.log("good is new: ", good);
```
```console
after bad: [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
fresh stays: [ 10, 20, 30 ]
good is new:  [ 10, 20, 30, 40 ]
```
*What just happened:* `addItemBad` called `push`, mutating the very array it was handed - `original` silently grew a `4` the caller never asked for. `addItemGood` instead spread the old items into a *new* array, leaving `fresh` untouched. The immutable version can't corrupt its caller's data, so it's safe to pass around freely.

The same pattern works for objects with spread, and for "removing" items with `filter`:

```javascript runnable
const user = { name: "Ada", role: "user" };

const promoted = { ...user, role: "admin" }; // new object, one field changed
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const noTwo = numbers.filter((n) => n !== 2); // new array without the 2

console.log("user unchanged:", user);
console.log("promoted:      ", promoted);
console.log("noTwo:         ", noTwo);
```
```console
user unchanged: { name: 'Ada', role: 'user' }
promoted:       { name: 'Ada', role: 'admin' }
noTwo:          [ 1, 3, 4 ]
```
*What just happened:* the spread copied every field of `user` and overrode `role` without touching `user`; `filter` built a new array without the `2`, never touching `numbers`. Rule of thumb: reach for `map`, `filter`, and spread (which return new data) instead of `push`, `splice`, and direct property assignment (which mutate).

## Composition (and a taste of currying)

**Composition** builds a bigger function by chaining small ones, so the output of each feeds the next. If your functions are pure, this is safe: no hidden state to trip over, so a pipeline is just "do this, then this, then this."

📝 **Composition** - combining simple functions into a more complex one by feeding each function's output into the next. `pipe(f, g)(x)` means `g(f(x))`: run `f` on `x`, then `g` on the result.

A tiny `pipe` is itself a higher-order function that takes functions and returns a function:

```javascript runnable
const pipe = (...fns) => (x) => fns.reduce((acc, fn) => fn(acc), x);

const trim = (s) => s.trim();
const lower = (s) => s.toLowerCase();
const exclaim = (s) => s + "!";

const shout = pipe(trim, lower, exclaim); // left-to-right pipeline

console.log(shout("  HELLO  "));
```
```console
hello!
```
*What just happened:* `reduce` ran the three functions left to right against `"  HELLO  "`: `trim`, then `lower`, then `exclaim`. (Mathematicians write composition right-to-left and call it `compose`; `pipe` is the same idea in reading order, which most people find clearer.)

**A taste of currying.** **Currying** turns a function that takes several arguments into a chain of functions that each take one - the shape you already saw in `multiplyBy`: call it with one argument now, get a function waiting for the rest. It's handy because pipelines and `map` want single-argument functions.

```javascript runnable
// Curried: take `factor` now, return a function waiting for `n`.
const multiply = (factor) => (n) => n * factor;
const add = (amount) => (n) => n + amount;

const pipe = (...fns) => (x) => fns.reduce((acc, fn) => fn(acc), x);

const transform = pipe(multiply(2), add(10)); // tidy single-arg functions
console.log(transform(5)); // (5 * 2) + 10
```
```console
20
```
*What just happened:* `multiply(2)` and `add(10)` are each pre-configured to a single argument, so they slot straight into `pipe` and read as a pipeline: double, then add ten.

⚠️ **Don't over-engineer.** It's tempting to take this far - deep `pipe` chains, everything curried, "point-free" code with no named intermediate values. Resist it when it hurts readability: the goal is code that's *easier* to understand, not a puzzle. A two-line composition the next person can read beats a clever one-liner they have to decode.

## Recap

1. **Functions are first-class values** - store, pass, and return them. The foundation the entire functional style is built on.
2. **Pure functions** return the same output for the same input and cause no side effects, making them trivial to test and impossible to surprise you. Push unavoidable side effects to the edges.
3. **Higher-order functions** take or return functions. Factories (return a function) and wrappers (take and enhance a function) generate and extend behavior without rewriting it.
4. **Immutability**: build new data (`map`, `filter`, spread) instead of mutating in place (`push`, `splice`, assignment) - defusing the shared-reference bugs from Phase 9.
5. **Composition** chains small functions into bigger ones (`pipe`); **currying** pre-configures functions to single arguments so they snap together.
6. ⚠️ Use these to make code *clearer*, not cleverer. Readability beats point-free wizardry.

## Quick check

    "explain": "A pure function returns the same output for the same input and has no side effects. `add(a, b)` depends only on its arguments and changes nothing outside itself. The others mutate outer state, write to storage, or return a value that depends on the clock rather than the input."
  },
  {
    "q": "Why prefer `return [...arr, item]` over `arr.push(item)` when adding to an array?",
    "choices": [
      "Spread builds a new array and leaves the original untouched, avoiding shared-reference bugs",
      "`push` is deprecated in modern JavaScript",
      "Spread is always faster than push",

    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explain": "`push` mutates the array in place, so it can silently change data a caller is still relying on (the reference trap). Spreading into a new array leaves the input alone, which is the immutable approach and prevents a whole class of \"why did this change?\" bugs."
  },

    "choices": [
      "`g(f(2))` - run f on 2, then run g on the result",
      "`f(g(2))` - run g first, then f",
      "`f(2) + g(2)` - run both on 2 and add the results",
      "`[f(2), g(2)]` - an array of both results"
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explain": "`pipe` runs the functions left to right, feeding each output into the next. So `pipe(f, g)(2)` applies `f` to `2`, then applies `g` to that result: `g(f(2))`. That left-to-right reading order is exactly why `pipe` is often clearer than mathematical right-to-left `compose`."
  }
