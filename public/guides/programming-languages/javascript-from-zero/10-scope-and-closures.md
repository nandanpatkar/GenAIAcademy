# Scope, Closures & Hoisting - How JavaScript Remembers

Phase 9 gave you a cheat-card line about hoisting. This phase is the machinery underneath every variable you've written - once you see it, three confusing behaviors stop being magic: why a loop variable inside `setTimeout` all shows the same number, why `let` and `var` behave differently in blocks, and the big one - **closures**, the feature powering callbacks, event handlers, React hooks, and the module pattern.

The whole phase rests on one question: *when JavaScript sees a variable name, where does it look for the value?* Answer that and everything else falls out of it.

## Scope and the scope chain - where names are looked up

**What it actually is.** **Scope** is the set of variables visible from a given spot in your code. Every function creates a new scope, nested inside the scope it was written in. JavaScript looks for a variable in the current scope first; if it's not there, it checks the scope *outside* that one, then the one outside *that*, all the way to global. That outward chain of lookups is the **scope chain**.

📝 **Lexical scope** - "lexical" means *where you wrote it*. A function's scope is decided by its physical position in the source code, not by where or how it's later called - JavaScript wires up the scope chain by reading your file, before anything runs.

```mermaid

  A["inner()<br/>sees: secret"] --> B["outer()<br/>sees: name"]
  B --> C["global<br/>sees: appName"]
  A -. "looks up 'appName'" .-> C
```

*One idea:* a name lookup only ever travels *outward*, never inward. `inner` can reach into `outer` and the global scope, but nothing outside `inner` can see `inner`'s variables. Watch the chain resolve a name:

```javascript runnable
const appName = "Manual";          // global scope

function outer() {
  const name = "Ada";              // outer's scope
  function inner() {
    const secret = 42;             // inner's scope
    console.log(secret, name, appName); // found at 3 different levels
  }
  inner();
}
outer();
```
```console
42 Ada Manual
```
*What just happened:* Inside `inner`, JavaScript found `secret` locally. It didn't find `name`, so it stepped out to `outer`'s scope - found it. Same for `appName`, one level further out. Three names, resolved at three links of the chain, all by walking outward.

⚠️ **Gotcha - lookups go out, not in.** Reading `secret` from inside `outer` (but outside `inner`) throws a `ReferenceError`. A scope is a one-way mirror: the inside sees out, the outside can't see in - why ten different functions can each have their own `name` variable without colliding.

## `var` vs `let`/`const` - function scope vs block scope

Here's the first place the rules diverge, and it's the source of a famous bug: the *unit* of scope each keyword respects.

📝 **Block scope** - a "block" is any `{ ... }`: an `if`, a `for`, a bare pair of braces. `let` and `const` are confined to the block they're declared in. **Function scope** - `var` ignores blocks entirely; it's visible throughout the *entire function* it lives in, no matter how deeply nested.

```javascript runnable
function test() {
  if (true) {
    var leaks = "I'm everywhere in test()";
    let trapped = "I'm stuck in this if-block";
    console.log(trapped);          // fine - same block
  }
  console.log(leaks);              // fine - var ignores the block
  console.log(typeof trapped);    // "undefined" - let didn't escape
}
test();
```
```console
I'm stuck in this if-block
I'm everywhere in test()
undefined
```
*What just happened:* `var leaks` was declared inside the `if` block, but `var` ignores blocks - it belongs to the whole function, so it's readable after the `if` closes. `let trapped` obeys the block: outside it, `typeof trapped` reports `"undefined"`. That leak is exactly why `var` causes trouble.

**The classic loop bug.** You loop, schedule some callbacks, and expect them to print `0, 1, 2`. With `var`, they all print `3`:

```javascript runnable
const withVar = [];
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  withVar.push(() => i);           // capture i... but which i?
}
console.log(withVar.map((fn) => fn())); // [3, 3, 3]

const withLet = [];
for (let j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
  withLet.push(() => j);
}
console.log(withLet.map((fn) => fn())); // [0, 1, 2]
```
```console
[ 3, 3, 3 ]
[ 0, 1, 2 ]
```
*What just happened:* With `var i`, there's exactly **one** `i` for the whole loop - function-scoped, shared by all three callbacks. By the time they run, the loop has finished and that single `i` is `3`. With `let j`, JavaScript creates a **fresh `j` for each iteration** - three separate variables, each captured with the value it had that round. This is the headline reason to default to `let`/`const` and treat `var` as legacy.

💡 **Key insight.** `let`/`const` being block-scoped isn't just tidier - it makes loops with closures *do what you mean*. The per-iteration binding is the whole fix; reach for `var` essentially never.

## Hoisting, properly - declarations come first

Before running a single line of a scope, JavaScript does a quick first pass: it finds all the declarations and sets them up. *That* is **hoisting** - declarations are processed before execution begins, as if lifted to the top of their scope. But "hoisting" doesn't mean every keyword behaves the same - there are three distinct behaviors.

**Function declarations are fully hoisted** - name and body are available before its line, so you can call it above where it's written.

**`var` is hoisted but left undefined** - the name is set up early (so using it isn't a `ReferenceError`), but its value isn't assigned until the line runs. Read it early and you get `undefined`.

**`let` and `const` are hoisted into the Temporal Dead Zone** - the name is reserved, but touching it before its declaration line throws.

📝 **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)** - the stretch from the start of a scope until a `let`/`const` declaration actually runs. The variable exists (the name is reserved) but is off-limits; reading it throws `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'x' before initialization`. It's JavaScript protecting you from using a value that isn't ready yet.

```javascript runnable
console.log(addUp(2, 3));    // 5 - function declaration is fully hoisted
console.log(maybe);          // undefined - var name exists, value doesn't yet
var maybe = "now I have a value";

function addUp(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

try {
  console.log(strict);       // throws - strict is in the TDZ
  let strict = "too late";
} catch (e) {
  console.log("TDZ error:", e.message);
}
```
```console
5
undefined
TDZ error: Cannot access 'strict' before initialization
```
*What just happened:* `addUp` ran before its definition because function declarations are hoisted whole. `maybe` printed `undefined` since `var` reserved the name but hadn't reached the assignment. `strict` threw, because `let` is hoisted only enough to know it exists. The habit that sidesteps all of this: **declare before you use, and prefer `const`.**

⚠️ **Gotcha - the TDZ is a feature, not a bug.** It's catching a real mistake: using a value the code hasn't computed yet. `var` makes that same mistake silent - `undefined`, with the bug surfacing far away. The TDZ fails loud and early, at the source.

## Closures - a function remembers where it was born

A **closure** is what you get when a function outlives the scope it was created in, and *keeps access to that scope's variables anyway* - it carries its birthplace with it.

📝 **Closure** - a function bundled together with the variables from the scope where it was *defined*. Even long after its outer function has returned, it can still read and update those captured variables - it remembers where it was born, not where it's called.

The counter factory is the canonical example:

```javascript runnable
function makeCounter() {
  let count = 0;                   // lives in makeCounter's scope
  return function () {
    count += 1;                    // reaches outward to count
    return count;
  };
}

const counter = makeCounter();     // makeCounter has now RETURNED
console.log(counter());            // 1
console.log(counter());            // 2
console.log(counter());            // 3

const fresh = makeCounter();       // a brand-new, independent count
console.log(fresh());              // 1
```
```console
1
2
3
1
```
*What just happened:* `makeCounter` ran, created `count`, and returned the inner function - then it was *done*. Normally `count` would vanish with it, but the returned function still references `count`, so JavaScript keeps it alive as long as the function exists. Each call reaches outward to the *same* `count` and bumps it. `fresh` is a separate call, so it gets its own `count` starting at `1` - closures don't share state across separate creations.

💡 **The mental model.** The function doesn't copy `count` - it holds a live link back to the exact scope it was born in. As long as the function is reachable, that scope stays alive: a closure is a function plus a backpack of the variables it grew up with.

**A real use - true data privacy.** Those captured variables aren't reachable from outside the closure - there's no `counter.count` to poke at, since the only way to touch `count` is through the function. That's genuinely private state, something JavaScript otherwise lacks:

```javascript runnable
function once(fn) {
  let called = false;              // private - nobody outside can flip this
  let result;
  return function (...args) {
    if (!called) {
      called = true;
      result = fn(...args);
    }
    return result;
  };
}

const setup = once(() => {
  console.log("running expensive setup...");
  return "ready";
});

console.log(setup());   // runs the body
console.log(setup());   // skips it - returns the cached result
console.log(setup());   // still cached
```
```console
running expensive setup...
ready
ready
ready
```
*What just happened:* `once` returns a wrapper closing over the private flag `called` and the cached `result`. The first call flips `called` and runs the real function; every call after sees `called === true` and returns the stored result without re-running. Nothing outside can reset `called` - it's sealed inside the closure. This pattern guards one-time initialization, single payment submissions, and "load it once" caches everywhere.

## Why it matters - closures are everywhere

You've been using closures since Phase 4 without naming them. Now you can see them:

- **Callbacks and event handlers.** `button.addEventListener("click", () => doThing(config))` closes over `config` - it still works whenever the click fires, minutes later, because the closure kept `config` alive.
- **The module pattern.** Wrapping code in a function and returning only what you want public is the closure-powered way to get private variables - how libraries hid internals before `import`/`export`.
- **React hooks.** `useState` and friends lean entirely on closures - each render's functions close over that render's values. (The loop-variable bug above is the #1 source of "stale closure" confusion in React.)
- **The cost.** A closure keeps its captured variables alive as long as the function lives - usually what you want, but a long-lived closure (an event handler you never remove) quietly keeps everything it captured in memory. Remove handlers you no longer need.

The thread tying the phase together: scope is decided by *where you write code*, hoisting decides *what's ready when execution starts*, and closures are scope *outliving* the function that created it.

## Recap

1. **Scope** is the set of visible variables; a name lookup walks the **scope chain** *outward* - local, then enclosing, then global - and never inward.
2. **Lexical scope** means scope is fixed by *where code is written*, not where it's called - JavaScript wires up the chain by reading the source.
3. **`var` is function-scoped** (it leaks out of blocks); **`let`/`const` are block-scoped**. The per-iteration binding of `let` is what fixes the classic `[3, 3, 3]` loop-in-callback bug.
4. **Hoisting** processes declarations first: functions are fully hoisted, `var` is hoisted-but-`undefined`, and `let`/`const` sit in the **Temporal Dead Zone** until their line runs.
5. A **closure** is a function plus the variables from its birthplace; it keeps those variables alive after the outer function returns, giving you private state and persistent counters.
6. Closures power **callbacks, event handlers, the module pattern, and React hooks** - but a long-lived closure holds its captured variables in memory, so release handlers you no longer need.

## Quick check

  {
    "q": "After `const c = makeCounter()` returns, why can the returned function still increment `count`?",
    "choices": [
      "The returned function is a closure - it holds a live link to the scope where it was defined, keeping `count` alive",
      "`count` was copied into the returned function as a private constant",
      "JavaScript re-runs `makeCounter` on every call to rebuild `count`",
      "`count` was secretly promoted to a global variable when makeCounter returned"
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explain": "A closure keeps the variables from its birthplace alive as long as the function exists. The returned function references `count`, so that scope isn't discarded - each call reaches the same live `count` and bumps it. A separate `makeCounter()` call gets its own independent `count`."
