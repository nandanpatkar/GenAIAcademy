# Syntax, Values & Types

Phase 1 got a program to print and run - the warm-up. Real programs hold things: a name, a count, a price -
and the rules C# uses to *store* those things shape almost everything you'll write next. Two ideas do the
heavy lifting: the compiler knows the type of every value before your code runs, and C# splits all values
into two camps - ones that *copy* when passed around, and ones that *share*. Get that split into your head
now and a whole category of "why did this change?" bugs never happens to you.

## Static typing - the compiler checks before you run

**What it actually is.** C# is **statically typed**: every variable has a fixed type locked in when
declared, and the compiler verifies every use of it *before the program runs*. A variable holding a whole
number can never later hold text - try it, and the build fails with a red squiggle, no runtime crash.

📝 **Static** means "checked at compile time," as opposed to *dynamic* ("checked while running"). C# checks
up front, so by the time your program runs, "what type is this?" is already answered and can't go wrong.

```csharp
int count = 0;
count = count + 1;     // fine: an int plus an int is an int
count = "hello";       // compile error: cannot convert string to int
```
*What just happened:* `int count = 0;` told the compiler "`count` is an integer, forever." Adding to it is
fine; assigning the text `"hello"` is a contradiction the compiler catches instantly with
`error CS0029: Cannot implicitly convert type 'string' to 'int'`. A whole class of "I thought this was a
number but it was text" mistakes simply cannot ship.

## Value types vs reference types - copy or share?

This is *the* idea in this phase.

📝 C# splits every type into two families:

- **Value types** hold their data *directly*. When you assign or pass one, you get a **copy** - a separate,
  independent value. These include `int`, `double`, `bool`, `char`, every `struct`, and every `enum`.
- **Reference types** hold a *reference* (a pointer) to data that lives elsewhere in memory. When you assign
  or pass one, you copy the *reference*, not the data - so both names now point at the **same** object.
  These include every `class`, plus `string` and arrays.

Why the split? Small, simple values (a number, a flag) are cheapest to copy. Big or shared things (an
object with many fields, a list everyone needs the same version of) are cheapest to pass by reference. The
catch: copy-vs-share changes *behavior*, not just performance - what trips people up.

A `struct` is a value type; a `class` is a reference type:

```csharp
struct PointVal { public int X; }   // value type
class PointRef  { public int X; }   // reference type

var a = new PointVal { X = 1 };
var b = a;                          // COPY - b is independent
b.X = 99;
// a.X is still 1, b.X is 99

var c = new PointRef { X = 1 };
var d = c;                          // SHARE - d points at the same object as c
d.X = 99;
// c.X is now 99 too - same object
```
```console
PointVal: a.X = 1,  b.X = 99
PointRef: c.X = 99, d.X = 99
```
*What just happened:* `b = a` copied the *whole struct*, so `b` is independent - changing `b.X` left `a`
untouched. But `d = c` only copied the *reference*; `c` and `d` name one object, so writing through `d`
changed what `c` sees too. Same line of code (`x = y`), opposite result - the only difference is whether
the type is a `struct` (value) or a `class` (reference).

⚠️ **The classic surprise: passing to a method.** The same rule applies when you hand a value to a method.
Pass a struct and the method works on a *copy* - your original is safe. Pass a class and it works on *your
actual object* - changes leak back out.

```csharp
struct Counter { public int N; }
class  Box     { public int N; }

void BumpStruct(Counter c) { c.N++; }   // bumps a copy
void BumpClass(Box b)      { b.N++; }   // bumps the caller's object

var counter = new Counter { N = 0 };
BumpStruct(counter);
// counter.N is still 0 - the method changed its own copy

var box = new Box { N = 0 };
BumpClass(box);
// box.N is now 1 - the method reached the real object
```
```console
counter.N = 0
box.N = 1
```
*What just happened:* `BumpStruct` received a *copy* of `counter`, incremented it, and threw it away -
`counter` never changed. `BumpClass` received a copy of the *reference*, still pointing at the caller's
`box`, so the increment stuck. A method that "didn't change my data" is almost always a value type; one
that "changed my data behind my back" is a reference type.

💡 **Key point.** Ask two questions about any type: *Does assigning it copy or share? Does passing it to a
method protect my original or expose it?* Value types copy and protect; reference types share and expose.
`null` only enters the picture for reference types and nullable value types (next) - only a reference can
point at "nothing."

## `var` - let the compiler infer the type

Spelling out the type twice gets old fast: `Dictionary<string, List<int>> map = new Dictionary<string,
List<int>>();` is a mouthful. `var` lets the compiler **infer** the type from the right side:

```csharp
var name = "Ada";          // compiler sees "Ada" is text → name is a string
var age = 36;              // compiler sees 36 is a whole number → age is an int
var price = 9.99;         // → double
var ready = true;         // → bool
```
*What just happened:* Each `var` told the compiler to figure out the type from the right-hand side. `name`
is *still* a `string` - fully static, fully checked - you just didn't write the word. `var` isn't "any type"
or dynamic; it's shorthand for a type the compiler can already see. `name = 42;` afterward is still the
same compile error, because `name`'s type was fixed the moment it was inferred.

💡 **When to use it.** Reach for `var` when the type is obvious from the right side (`var user = new
User();`) or genuinely long to spell out. Prefer the explicit type when the value alone doesn't make it
clear (`var result = Process();` - what *is* `result`?). The goal is readability, not saving keystrokes.

## Nullability - the war on NullReferenceException

📝 `null` means "this reference points at nothing." Read a value off a `null` reference and you get a
`NullReferenceException` - historically C#'s single most common crash. Modern C# fights back on two fronts.

**Nullable value types.** Value types like `int` can't normally be `null` - they always hold a real number.
But sometimes you need "a number, or nothing yet" (an unanswered survey field, say). Add a `?` to make a
**nullable value type**:

```csharp
int score = 0;            // always a number; cannot be null
int? maybeScore = null;   // a number OR null - note the ?

if (maybeScore.HasValue)
    Console.WriteLine(maybeScore.Value);
else
    Console.WriteLine("no score yet");
```
```console
no score yet
```
*What just happened:* `int` refuses `null` outright. `int?` (shorthand for `Nullable<int>`) adds one extra
state - "nothing" - modeling "not answered yet" honestly instead of faking it with `-1` or `0`.

**Nullable reference types.** Reference types have *always* been able to be `null`, exactly why crashes
were so common. Modern C# (`<Nullable>enable</Nullable>` in your project file, default for new projects)
flips this: you must *opt in* to nullability. A plain `string` means "never null"; `string?` means "might
be null" - and the compiler *warns* you whenever you risk dereferencing a possible `null`.

```csharp
#nullable enable
string name = "Ada";       // promises: never null
string? note = null;       // allowed to be null

Console.WriteLine(name.Length);   // fine - name can't be null
Console.WriteLine(note.Length);   // warning CS8602: possible null dereference
```
*What just happened:* With nullability enabled, `name` is *non-nullable* - the compiler trusts it's never
`null` and lets you use it freely. `note` is a `string?`, so reading `note.Length` earns a warning: "this
might be `null`, you didn't check." The compiler moves the `NullReferenceException` from a 3-a.m.
production crash to a squiggle in your editor. ⚠️ These are *warnings*, not errors, so it's tempting to
ignore them. Don't: each is a real crash the compiler spotted for you. (Deep dive on nullability and the
`?.` / `??` operators in [Phase 13](13-records-and-modern-csharp.md).)

## Strings - text done the C# way

Strings get their own section for a couple of quietly important behaviors.

📝 A `string` is a **reference type**, but an **immutable** one: once created, its characters never change.
Every operation that looks like it modifies a string (uppercasing, replacing, concatenating) builds a
*brand-new* string and leaves the original alone.

The most useful everyday feature is **string interpolation** - prefix with `$` and drop expressions right
inside `{ }`:

```csharp
var name = "Ada";
var age = 36;
var greeting = $"Hello {name}, you are {age} years old.";
Console.WriteLine(greeting);
Console.WriteLine($"Next year: {age + 1}");   // expressions work too
```
```console
Hello Ada, you are 36 years old.
Next year: 37
```
*What just happened:* The `$` turns the string into a template; each `{ ... }` is evaluated and its result
dropped in. `{age + 1}` shows real expressions work inside, not just variable names - far cleaner than
gluing strings with `+`, and what you'll use almost every time.

⚠️ **The equality gotcha - `==` on strings compares *value*.** Coming from Java, this surprises people: in
Java, `==` compares *references* (same object?), so you need `.equals()`. In C#, `==` on strings is
overloaded to compare the actual *text*:

```csharp
var a = "hello";
var b = "hel" + "lo";       // a different object, same text
Console.WriteLine(a == b);  // True - compares the characters
```
```console
True
```
*What just happened:* `a` and `b` are (potentially) different objects, but `==` on `string` compares their
*contents*, so you get `True`. This is special to `string` - your *own* classes compare references by
default, a different story told in [Phase 9](09-idioms-and-gotchas.md). For now: strings compare by value
with `==`, and that's the one you want.

Two more string forms: **verbatim strings** (`@"..."`) turn off escape sequences, so backslashes and line
breaks are literal - perfect for Windows paths and regex. **Raw string literals** (`"""..."""`) let you
paste multi-line text (JSON, SQL, HTML) without escaping anything:

```csharp
var path = @"C:\Users\Ada\file.txt";          // no doubled backslashes needed
var json = """
    { "name": "Ada", "age": 36 }
    """;                                       // quotes inside need no escaping
Console.WriteLine(path);
Console.WriteLine(json);
```
```console
C:\Users\Ada\file.txt
{ "name": "Ada", "age": 36 }
```
*What just happened:* In a normal string, `"C:\Users"` would treat `\U` as an escape and break. `@` says
"take this literally," so backslashes stand as-is. The `"""` raw string holds a block with embedded `"`
quotes and newlines, no escaping required - the compiler even strips leading indentation up to the closing
`"""`. Reach for `@"..."` for paths and `"""..."""` for chunks of structured text.

## Recap

1. **C# is statically typed** - every variable's type is fixed at declaration and checked at *compile time*,
   so type mismatches fail the build instead of crashing at runtime.
2. **Value vs reference is the big split.** Value types (`int`, `double`, `bool`, `struct`, `enum`) hold data
   directly and **copy** on assignment and method calls. Reference types (`class`, `string`, arrays) hold a
   reference and **share** - both names point at the same object.
3. ⚠️ Passing a **struct** to a method protects your original (it gets a copy); passing a **class** exposes
   it (the method reaches your real object).
4. **`var`** infers the type from the right-hand side - still fully static, just less typing. Use it when
   the type is obvious.
5. **Nullability:** `int?` adds "nothing" to a value type; modern **nullable reference types** make `string`
   non-null and `string?` maybe-null, with compiler warnings to kill `NullReferenceException` early.
6. **Strings** are immutable reference types. Use `$"..."` interpolation; remember `==` compares **value**
   (unlike Java); use `@"..."` for paths and `"""..."""` for multi-line text.

Next, we move from single values to *collections* - arrays, the `List<T>` you'll actually use, and
dictionaries for looking things up by key.

## Quick check

Test yourself on the idea that matters most - copy versus share:

```quiz
[
  {
    "q": "You have a `struct Point` and write `var b = a;` then `b.X = 99;`. What is `a.X`?",
    "choices": [
      "Unchanged - a struct is a value type, so `b = a` made an independent copy",
      "99 - `b` and `a` point at the same object",
      "0 - assigning a struct resets its fields",
      "A compile error - you can't copy a struct"
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explain": "A struct is a value type: assignment copies the whole value, so `b` is independent of `a`. Changing `b.X` leaves `a.X` exactly as it was. If `Point` were a `class` (reference type), `b = a` would share the object and `a.X` would become 99 too."
  },
  {
    "q": "With nullable reference types enabled, what's the difference between `string` and `string?`?",
    "choices": [
      "`string` is non-nullable (the compiler warns if it might be null); `string?` is allowed to be null",
      "`string` is a value type and `string?` is a reference type",
      "There is no difference - the `?` is just a style preference",
      "`string?` is faster because it skips null checks"
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explain": "Under `<Nullable>enable</Nullable>`, a plain `string` promises it's never null and the compiler warns when you risk dereferencing a possible null. `string?` explicitly permits null. The point is to surface NullReferenceException risks as compile-time warnings instead of runtime crashes."
  },
  {
    "q": "In C#, what does `==` do when both operands are strings?",
    "choices": [
      "Compares the actual text (their characters) for equality",
      "Compares whether they're the same object in memory, like Java",
      "Always returns false unless they're literally the same literal",
      "Throws an exception - you must use `.Equals()` for strings"
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explain": "`==` is overloaded for `string` to compare value (the characters), so two different string objects with the same text are equal. This differs from Java, where `==` compares references. Note that for your own classes, `==` compares references by default - string is the special case."
  }
]
