# Generics, Deep - Type Safety Without Duplication

Back in [Phase 3](03-collections.md) you wrote `List<String>` and moved on - strings in, strings out, no casting. That `<String>` was your first taste of generics.

The mental model for this phase: **generics let you write one piece of code that works for many types while the compiler still checks every type for you.** Before generics, you got reuse *or* safety, never both. Generics give you both, and pay for it with a single weird runtime tax called type erasure. Once you understand that trade, the confusing parts - wildcards, the compiler's errors - become consequences instead of arbitrary rules.

## Why generics exist - the pain they replaced

Before Java 5, collections held `Object` - the universal supertype every class extends. A list could hold anything, which sounds flexible until you try to *get something back out*.

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

// Pre-generics style: a raw list holds Object.
List names = new ArrayList();
names.add("Ada");
names.add("Grace");
names.add(42);                  // oops - nothing stops this

// Getting a value back gives you an Object. You must cast.
String first = (String) names.get(0);   // fine
String third = (String) names.get(2);   // 42 is not a String...
```
```console
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ClassCastException:
  class java.lang.Integer cannot be cast to class java.lang.String
```
*What just happened:* the raw `List` accepted a `String`, a `String`, and an `Integer` without complaint - to it, they're all just `Object`. The trouble surfaced at `names.get(2)`: the cast promised a `String`, the promise was a lie, and the JVM threw `ClassCastException` **at runtime**, after the bug shipped.

Now the same idea with generics:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

List<String> names = new ArrayList<>();
names.add("Ada");
names.add(42);                  // compile error - caught before you run
```
```console
error: incompatible types: int cannot be converted to String
        names.add(42);
                  ^
```
*What just happened:* `List<String>` told the compiler "this list holds strings, full stop." The bad `add(42)` was rejected **at compile time** - the program never even built. And since the compiler knows the element type, `names.get(0)` hands you a `String` directly, no cast required. 💡 A compile error is a gift - it's a runtime crash caught early, when it's cheap to fix.

## Generic methods and classes - `<T>` is a parameter for types

The `<String>` you've been writing is *using* a generic type. Now you'll *write* one. A **type parameter** is a placeholder for a type, written in angle brackets, filled in at the call site - exactly like a regular parameter is a placeholder for a value.

📝 **Type parameter** - a stand-in name (conventionally a single uppercase letter: `T` for "type," `E` for "element," `K`/`V` for "key"/"value") for a type the caller will supply, letting one definition serve every type.

A **generic method** declares its type parameter before the return type:

```java
import java.util.List;

// <T> says "this method introduces a type parameter named T."
// It works for a List of ANY type, returning that same type.
static <T> T first(List<T> list) {
    return list.get(0);
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    List<String> words = List.of("alpha", "beta");
    List<Integer> nums = List.of(10, 20, 30);

    String w = first(words);    // T inferred as String
    int n = first(nums);        // T inferred as Integer
    System.out.println(w + " " + n);
}
```
```console
alpha 10
```
*What just happened:* `<T>` introduced a type parameter; `T` stands for whatever type the list holds, and the return type `T` means "same type I received." You never wrote `<String>` or `<Integer>` at the call sites - the compiler performed **type inference** off the argument, so `first(words)` made `T` be `String` and `w` needs no cast.

A **generic class** puts the type parameter on the class itself, so every instance is bound to a chosen type:

```java
// Box<T>: a container holding exactly one value of some type T.
class Box<T> {
    private final T value;

    Box(T value) {
        this.value = value;
    }

    T get() {
        return value;
    }
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    Box<String> nameBox = new Box<>("Ada");   // T = String for this box
    Box<Integer> ageBox = new Box<>(36);      // T = Integer for this box

    String name = nameBox.get();              // no cast - compiler knows it's String
    System.out.println(name + " is " + ageBox.get());
}
```
*What just happened:* `class Box<T>` declared `T` once, and the whole class body - field, constructor, return type - could use it. `new Box<>("Ada")` (the `<>` "diamond") let the compiler infer `T` as `String`, so `nameBox.get()` returns a `String` directly; `ageBox` is a separate binding where `T` is `Integer`. `List<E>`, `Optional<T>`, and `Map<K, V>` are built the same way.

## Bounded type parameters - "any type, *as long as*"

A bare `<T>` means "literally any type" - too generous if your method needs to compare, add, or call a method on `T`, since not every type supports that. A **bounded type parameter** narrows the allowed types and unlocks the operations that bound guarantees.

📝 **Bound** - a constraint of the form `<T extends SomeType>` meaning "`T` must be `SomeType` or a subtype of it." It restricts which types the caller may use *and* lets the method body rely on everything `SomeType` provides. (`extends` here means "is-a," covering both extending classes and implementing interfaces.)

The classic case: finding the maximum of a list. To compare two `T`s, each must know how to compare *itself* - exactly what `Comparable` promises:

```java
import java.util.List;

// T must implement Comparable<T> - i.e. T values can be compared to each other.
static <T extends Comparable<T>> T max(List<T> list) {
    T biggest = list.get(0);
    for (T item : list) {
        if (item.compareTo(biggest) > 0) {   // legal ONLY because of the bound
            biggest = item;
        }
    }
    return biggest;
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(max(List.of(3, 9, 2, 7)));        // Integer is Comparable
    System.out.println(max(List.of("pear", "fig", "kiwi"))); // String is Comparable
}
```
```console
9
pear
```
*What just happened:* `<T extends Comparable<T>>` reads "for any type `T` that can be compared to itself" - what makes `item.compareTo(biggest)` legal; without it, `T` might have no `compareTo`. `Integer` and `String` both implement `Comparable`, so both work. The bound does double duty: keeps out incomparable types, grants the method the right to compare.

A bound that isn't met stops the compiler cold:

```java
// A plain class that does NOT implement Comparable.
class Widget {}

static <T extends Number> double sum(List<T> list) {
    double total = 0;
    for (T item : list) {
        total += item.doubleValue();   // doubleValue() comes from Number
    }
    return total;
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    sum(List.of(1, 2, 3));                 // fine: Integer extends Number
    sum(List.of(new Widget(), new Widget())); // bound violated
}
```
```console
error: method sum in class Demo cannot be applied to given types;
  required: List<T>
  found:    List<Widget>
  reason: inference variable T has incompatible bounds
    upper bounds: Number
    Widget is not within its upper bound
```
*What just happened:* `<T extends Number>` only admits `Number` and its subtypes (`Integer`, `Double`, `Long`, ...), making `item.doubleValue()` safe. `Integer` satisfies the bound, so the first call compiles; `Widget` doesn't extend `Number`, so the second is rejected before the program runs - "Widget is not within its upper bound."

## Wildcards and PECS - the part everyone trips on

⚠️ This section trips people up - not because the rule is hard, but because the *reason* behind it is unintuitive. We'll build the intuition, not just hand you the mnemonic.

You'd think `List<Integer>` is a kind of `List<Number>`, since an `Integer` *is* a `Number`. It is not:

```java
import java.util.List;

List<Integer> ints = List.of(1, 2, 3);
List<Number> nums = ints;        // does NOT compile
```
```console
error: incompatible types: List<Integer> cannot be converted to List<Number>
```
*What just happened:* generics are **invariant** - `List<Integer>` and `List<Number>` are unrelated types even though `Integer` extends `Number`. If it were allowed, `nums.add(3.14)` would look fine (a `Double` is a `Number`) but would stuff a `Double` into a list the rest of your code believes holds only `Integer`s. Invariance stops that.

But invariance is sometimes too strict - a method that sums a list of numbers should accept `List<Integer>`, `List<Double>`, and `List<Long>` alike. **Wildcards** (`?`) restore that flexibility safely, in two mirror-image flavors.

📝 **Upper-bounded wildcard `? extends T`** - "some specific subtype of `T`, but I don't know which." You can *read* `T`s out of it. **Lower-bounded wildcard `? super T`** - "some specific supertype of `T`, but I don't know which." You can *write* `T`s into it.

`? extends T` makes a collection a **producer** - a source you read from:

```java
import java.util.List;

// Accepts a List of ANY subtype of Number - reads values out and sums them.
static double sumAll(List<? extends Number> list) {
    double total = 0;
    for (Number n : list) {          // reading as Number is always safe
        total += n.doubleValue();
    }
    return total;
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(sumAll(List.of(1, 2, 3)));        // List<Integer> - OK!
    System.out.println(sumAll(List.of(1.5, 2.5)));       // List<Double>  - OK!
}
```
*What just happened:* `List<? extends Number>` means "a list of *some* unknown subtype of `Number`" - loose enough to accept both `List<Integer>` and `List<Double>`. Reading is safe: whatever the real element type is, it's *some* kind of `Number`, so pulling items out as `Number` always works.

You cannot *add* to a `? extends` collection - the famous head-scratcher:

```java
static void brokenAdd(List<? extends Number> list) {
    list.add(42);    // does NOT compile
}
```
```console
error: incompatible types: int cannot be converted to CAP#1
  where CAP#1 is a fresh type-variable:
    CAP#1 extends Number from capture of ? extends Number
```
*What just happened:* the compiler refuses `list.add(42)` because it doesn't know the *real* element type - `list` might be a `List<Double>`, and an `Integer` would corrupt it. With `? extends`, the unknown type sits on the *output* side: take `Number`s out, put nothing in (except `null`) - read-only from the caller's view.

The mirror image is `? super T`, which makes a collection a **consumer** - a sink you write into:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

// Accepts any list that can HOLD an Integer: List<Integer>, List<Number>, List<Object>.
static void addThree(List<? super Integer> sink) {
    sink.add(1);     // safe: a List<Number> or List<Object> can hold an Integer
    sink.add(2);
    sink.add(3);
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    List<Number> nums = new ArrayList<>();
    addThree(nums);              // works - Number is a supertype of Integer
    System.out.println(nums);
}
```
```console
[1, 2, 3]
```
*What just happened:* `List<? super Integer>` means "`Integer` or any supertype." Writing `Integer`s in is always safe - a `List<Number>` or `List<Object>` can hold one. Reading is restricted: the best the compiler can promise is `Object`, since the real list might hold any supertype. The unknown type sits on the *input* side: put `Integer`s in, can't pull specific types out.

That symmetry has a mnemonic the whole Java world uses:

📝 **PECS - Producer Extends, Consumer Super.** If a parameter *produces* values you'll read, use `? extends T`. If it *consumes* values you'll write, use `? super T`. (Pulling fruit *out* of a basket? The basket is a producer → `extends`. Dropping fruit *into* it? Consumer → `super`.)

💡 **Key point.** The wildcard puts the "I don't know exactly which type" on whichever side is *unsafe*. `? extends` doesn't know what you'd be adding, so it bans adds; `? super` doesn't know what you'd be reading, so it bans typed reads - the minimum restrictions that keep you from corrupting a collection whose real type you can't see.

## Type erasure - generics are a compile-time ghost

This explains a whole category of "wait, *why* can't I do that?" errors. All the type safety above happens at **compile time**. Once the compiler is satisfied, it throws the type information away - at runtime, the generics are gone.

📝 **Type erasure** - the compiler uses type parameters to check your code, then erases them, replacing each `T` with its bound (or `Object` if unbounded). The resulting bytecode has no generics at all - `List<String>` and `List<Integer>` compile down to the same plain `List`.

Watch the erasure with a runtime class check:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public static void main(String[] args) {
    List<String> strings = new ArrayList<>();
    List<Integer> integers = new ArrayList<>();

    // At runtime, both are just "ArrayList" - the <String>/<Integer> is gone.
    System.out.println(strings.getClass() == integers.getClass());
}
```
```console
true
```
*What just happened:* `List<String>` and `List<Integer>` are different types to the *compiler*, which kept your strings and integers from mixing. But `getClass()` asks the *runtime*, which sees only `ArrayList` for both - the type parameter was erased after doing its job.

This single fact explains a cluster of restrictions that otherwise look arbitrary:

```java
class Box<T> {
    T makeOne() {
        return new T();      // does NOT compile
    }
}
```
```console
error: type parameter T cannot be instantiated directly
        return new T();
               ^
```
*What just happened:* you can't write `new T()` because at runtime there is no `T` - it's erased to `Object`, and the JVM wouldn't know which constructor to call. The same erasure forbids `new T[10]` (no generic array creation) and makes this illegal:

```java
class Printer {
    void print(List<String> items) {}    // erases to print(List)
    void print(List<Integer> items) {}   // ALSO erases to print(List) - clash!
}
```
```console
error: name clash: print(List<String>) and print(List<Integer>)
  have the same erasure
```
*What just happened:* overloading `print` on `List<String>` versus `List<Integer>` fails because both erase to `print(List)` - identical in bytecode though distinct in source. The "same erasure" error.

💡 **Key point.** Generics protect you at compile time, then vanish. Whenever the compiler complains about `T` at runtime-shaped operations (`new`, arrays, `instanceof`, overloading), ask "what is `T` after erasure?" The answer - usually `Object` - explains the restriction. Generics are a compile-time fiction the compiler maintains for *you*; the JVM never sees them.

## Recap

1. **Generics move type safety from runtime to compile time.** Before them, collections held `Object` and forced casts that blew up as `ClassCastException`; `List<String>` makes the same mistake a compile error instead.
2. **Type parameters** (`<T>`) are placeholders for types. A **generic method** declares `<T>` before its return type; a **generic class** (`Box<T>`) declares it on the class. The compiler **infers** the type at the call site.
3. **Bounded type parameters** (`<T extends Comparable<T>>`, `<T extends Number>`) restrict which types are allowed *and* unlock the operations that bound guarantees - the body can call `compareTo` or `doubleValue` only because the bound promised them.
4. **Wildcards** fix invariance safely. **PECS - Producer Extends, Consumer Super**: read from `? extends T` (no adding), write to `? super T` (no reading specific types). The unknown type goes on whichever side would be unsafe.
5. **Type erasure** means generics are compile-time only - `T` becomes its bound (usually `Object`) in the bytecode, so `List<String>` and `List<Integer>` are the same class at runtime. That's why you can't write `new T()`, `new T[]`, or overload on erased types.

You can now read other people's generic signatures, write your own, and decode the compiler's type complaints instead of guessing. Next: **lambdas and functional interfaces** - passing behavior around as values, which leans on generics constantly (`Function<T, R>`, `Predicate<T>`) to stay type-safe.

## Quick check

Test yourself on the three ideas that matter most - bounds, PECS, and erasure:

```quiz
[
  {
    "q": "Why does `static <T extends Comparable<T>> T max(List<T> list)` need the `extends Comparable<T>` bound?",
    "choices": [
      "Without it, the compiler can't guarantee values of T support compareTo, so the comparison in the body would be rejected",
      "It makes the method run faster by skipping runtime type checks",
      "It forces the list to be stored on the heap instead of the stack",
      "It's optional styling - the method compiles fine with a bare <T>"
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explain": "A bound both restricts which types T may be and unlocks that type's methods inside the body. Comparable provides compareTo; without the bound, T could be a non-comparable type, so item.compareTo(biggest) would be rejected."
  },
  {
    "q": "You have `List<? extends Number> list`. Why does `list.add(42)` fail to compile?",
    "choices": [
      "The real element type is unknown - it might be List<Double> - so adding an Integer could corrupt it; ? extends is read-only",
      "42 is too large to be a valid Number",

      "You must call list.allowAdd() first to enable writing"
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explain": "With ? extends Number, the compiler only knows the list holds SOME unknown subtype of Number. It can't let you add anything (you might put an Integer into a List<Double>). You can read elements as Number, but not write - Producer Extends."
  },
  {
    "q": "At runtime, what does `new ArrayList<String>().getClass() == new ArrayList<Integer>().getClass()` evaluate to, and why?",
    "choices": [
      "true - type erasure removes the type parameter, so both are just ArrayList at runtime",
      "false - they are permanently different types, even at runtime",
      "It throws a ClassCastException because the types don't match",
      "true - but only because both lists happen to be empty"
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explain": "Generics are erased after compilation: List<String> and List<Integer> both become plain ArrayList in the bytecode. getClass() asks the runtime, which sees only ArrayList for both - so the comparison is true. This same erasure is why you can't do new T() or overload on erased types."
  }
]
