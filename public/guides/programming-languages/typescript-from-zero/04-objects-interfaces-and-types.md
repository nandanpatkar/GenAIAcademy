# Objects, Interfaces & Type Aliases - Describing Shapes

So far you've typed individual values - a `string` here, a `number` there. But look at the code you write all day: almost none of it is loose values. It's *objects* - a user, a product, a request, a config, bundles of related fields traveling together. This is where typing starts genuinely paying off, because TypeScript lets you describe the *shape* of those bundles once and reuse it everywhere.

**A type for an object is a contract about its shape** - which fields exist, and what type each is. Write it down once, give it a name, and the checker enforces it everywhere that shape appears. Misspell a field, forget a required one, pass the wrong kind of value - caught in the editor, before anything runs.

## Inline object types - fine for one-offs, tiring at scale

The most direct way to type an object is to write its shape right where you need it, in `{ ... }` braces.

```typescript
function greet(user: { name: string; age: number }): string {
  return `Hi ${user.name}, you are ${user.age}`;
}

greet({ name: "Ada", age: 36 }); // ok
```

*What just happened:* `{ name: string; age: number }` is the object's shape spelled out in place - `user` must have a `name` string and an `age` number. The field separator inside the braces can be a semicolon or comma; semicolons are the convention.

This is reasonable for a shape used in one spot. The trouble starts the moment a second function needs the *same* shape:

```typescript
function greet(user: { name: string; age: number }): string {
  return `Hi ${user.name}`;
}

function canVote(user: { name: string; age: number }): boolean {
  return user.age >= 18;
}
```

*What just happened:* The exact same shape is written twice. If `user` later grows an `email` field, you have to hunt down and update *every* inline copy - miss one and they silently disagree about what a "user" is. Repetition like this signals the shape deserves a name.

## `interface` - give a shape a name

The cleanest way to name an object shape is an **interface**.

📝 **Interface** - a named description of an object's shape: its properties and each one's type. Declare it once with `interface Name { ... }`, then use `Name` anywhere you'd otherwise spell the shape out inline.

```typescript
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

function greet(user: User): string {
  return `Hi ${user.name}`;
}

function canVote(user: User): boolean {
  return user.age >= 18;
}

greet({ name: "Ada", age: 36 }); // ok
```

*What just happened:* `interface User` defines the shape once. Both functions annotate their parameter as `User` instead of repeating the braces - "what a user is" lives in exactly one place. An interface generates no JavaScript; like all types, it's erased at compile time and exists purely to guide the checker.

Now watch the contract work. Leave out a required field and the checker stops you cold:

```typescript
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

const u: User = { name: "Ada" }; // missing age
```
```console
Property 'age' is missing in type '{ name: string; }' but required in type 'User'.
```

*What just happened:* `User` says every user has both `name` *and* `age`. `{ name: "Ada" }` has no `age`, so the assignment violates the contract, and TypeScript points at the exact missing property - in your editor, before you run a thing. The omission surfaces at edit-time, not as a confusing `undefined` three screens away.

## `type` aliases - name *anything*, not only objects

There's a second way to name a shape: a **type alias**.

📝 **Type alias** - the `type` keyword binds a name to *any* type expression: an object shape, but also a union, a primitive, a tuple, or a function type. `type ID = string | number` names something an interface can't.

For an object, a `type` alias looks almost identical to an interface.

```typescript
type User = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

function greet(user: User): string {
  return `Hi ${user.name}`;
}
```

*What just happened:* `type User = { ... }` names the same shape an interface would - note the `=` sign and trailing semicolon, which `type` uses and `interface` doesn't. As a parameter annotation, it behaves exactly like the interface version.

The difference shows when naming something that *isn't* an object. An interface can only describe an object shape; a `type` alias can name a union, a primitive, or a tuple.

```typescript
type ID = string | number;        // a union - interface can't do this
type Pair = [number, number];     // a tuple
type Name = string;               // an alias for a primitive

const a: ID = "abc123";
const b: ID = 42;
const point: Pair = [3, 4];
```

*What just happened:* `ID` names "a string *or* a number" - a union type (more on those next phase). `Pair` names a two-element tuple; `Name` is a readable alias for `string`. None are object shapes, so none could be an `interface`. This breadth is the type alias's superpower: it names *any* type, not only objects.

## `interface` vs `type` - the honest guidance

The straight answer to the question everyone trips on: **for object shapes, `interface` and `type` are mostly interchangeable.** Both name a shape, both get enforced identically, both support optional and readonly fields and extension. You can write almost any real codebase using only one.

The differences are real but narrow:

- **`interface` can be re-opened (declaration merging).** Declare `interface User` twice and TypeScript *merges* them into one. A `type` alias can't be redeclared - a second `type User` is an error. Merging is mostly for augmenting library types; it's why interfaces are conventional for *public* object APIs others might extend.
- **`type` can express things an interface can't** - unions, tuples, primitives, and (later) intersections and mapped types.

💡 **Rule of thumb.** Reach for **`interface` when describing an object shape** - it's the convention, error messages read a touch nicer, and it leaves the door open for merging. Reach for **`type` when you need a union, a tuple, or anything an interface can't express.** Don't agonize: pick `interface` for objects and move on. The compiler tells you when the other form is needed by rejecting what it can't do.

## Optional, `readonly`, and extending

Three small tools turn basic shapes into the ones you'll actually write: optional fields, read-only fields, and building one shape on another.

**Optional properties with `?`.** Putting `?` after a field's name makes it optional - present or absent - and code reading it must account for it possibly being `undefined`.

```typescript
interface User {
  name: string;
  email?: string; // optional - may or may not be there
}

const a: User = { name: "Ada" };                       // ok, no email
const b: User = { name: "Grace", email: "g@xyz.io" };  // ok, with email
```

*What just happened:* The `?` on `email` makes it optional, so both objects satisfy `User` - one with an email, one without. The type of `email` is effectively `string | undefined`, so using it, the checker will nudge you to handle the missing case. Optional is for fields that genuinely might not be there, not a license to skip required data.

**Read-only fields with `readonly`.** Prefix a field with `readonly` and TypeScript forbids reassigning it after creation - for values set once and never changed, like an `id` or a creation timestamp.

```typescript
interface User {
  readonly id: number;
  name: string;
}

const u: User = { id: 1, name: "Ada" };
u.name = "Ada L.";  // ok - name is writable
u.id = 2;           // not allowed
```
```console
Cannot assign to 'id' because it is a read-only property.
```

*What just happened:* You set `id` once when the object was built. Reassigning `name` is fine, but changing `id` is rejected at compile time. ⚠️ `readonly` is a *compile-time* guarantee only - erased before the code runs, so it stops *you* in the editor but does nothing to a value at runtime. It enforces intent during development; it is not a runtime lock.

**Extending a shape.** Real shapes build on each other - an `Admin` is a `User` with extra fields. Interfaces use `extends`; type aliases use an intersection `&`. Both produce "everything from the base, plus the new fields."

```typescript
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

interface Admin extends User {
  role: "admin";   // plus everything from User
}

const root: Admin = { name: "Ada", age: 36, role: "admin" };

// The type-alias equivalent, using intersection:
type AdminAlias = User & { role: "admin" };
```

*What just happened:* `interface Admin extends User` means an `Admin` has `name`, `age`, *and* `role` - the object must supply all three. `type AdminAlias = User & { role: "admin" }` does the same with an intersection (`&`), combining shapes into one with every member of both. Pick `extends` in interfaces and `&` in type aliases; the resulting contract is equivalent.

## Recap

1. **Inline object types** (`{ name: string; age: number }`) work for a one-off, but repeating the same shape across functions is a maintenance trap - the signal to name it.
2. An **`interface`** names an object's shape once and reuses it everywhere; the checker enforces the contract, flagging a missing required field right in the editor.
3. A **`type` alias** also names object shapes, but goes further: it can name **unions, tuples, and primitives** - things an interface can't express.
4. For object shapes the two are **mostly interchangeable**. Rule of thumb: **`interface` for object shapes, `type` when you need a union or something an interface can't do.**
5. **`?`** makes a field optional (possibly `undefined`); **`readonly`** forbids reassignment after creation. ⚠️ It's a compile-time check, erased at runtime - not a runtime lock.
6. Build shapes on each other with **`interface Admin extends User`** or the type-alias equivalent **`User & { ... }`** - both mean "everything from the base, plus more."

You can now describe the shape of real data and reuse it. Next, the other half: values that can be *one of several* things - a status that's `"loading"` or `"done"`, an id that's a string *or* a number - and how TypeScript narrows them safely.

## Quick check

Lock in the three decisions you'll make constantly - interface vs type, optional vs required, and what `readonly` actually guarantees:

    "q": "You need to name a type that is `string | number`. Which tool can express it?",
    "choices": [
      "A `type` alias - `type ID = string | number`",
      "An `interface` - `interface ID { string | number }`",
      "Either one; interfaces support unions too",
      "Neither; unions can't be named in TypeScript"
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explain": "An interface can only describe an object shape. A union like `string | number` isn't an object, so only a `type` alias can name it. This is the main reason to reach for `type` over `interface`."
  },
  {
    "q": "Given `interface User { name: string; email?: string }`, which object is valid?",
    "choices": [
      "`{ name: \"Ada\" }` - `email` is optional, so it can be omitted",
      "`{ email: \"a@x.io\" }` - only one field is needed",
      "`{}` - every field is optional once any field is",
      "Only `{ name: \"Ada\", email: \"a@x.io\" }` - both fields are required"
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explain": "The `?` on `email` makes it optional, so it may be absent. But `name` has no `?`, so it's still required - an object must include `name` and may or may not include `email`."
  },
  {
    "q": "What does `readonly id: number` actually guarantee?",
    "choices": [
      "The compiler rejects reassigning `id` after creation, but it's erased at runtime - not a runtime lock",
      "The value of `id` is frozen at runtime and any reassignment throws an error",
      "`id` can never be set at all, not even when the object is created",
      "Other fields on the object also become read-only automatically"
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explain": "`readonly` is a compile-time guarantee: TypeScript flags an attempt to reassign `id` in your editor. Like all types it's erased before the code runs, so it enforces intent during development but does nothing at runtime."
