# Idioms & Common Gotchas

You can write working Go without knowing any of this. But the gap between "compiles and runs" and "looks like Go" is a handful of conventions - plus a short list of gotchas, mostly about how Go quietly *shares* memory, that bite essentially every developer once.

The idioms: Go prefers *small, composable pieces over big inheritance hierarchies* - small interfaces, structs glued together by embedding, functions that take a narrow interface and hand back a concrete thing. The gotchas: *Go does what it says, not what you assumed*, and the assumptions that trip people up are almost always about slices, loops, and `nil`.

## Interfaces: small, and satisfied implicitly

An interface is a list of method signatures - a description of behavior, not data. Go's twist: a type satisfies an interface *automatically*, just by having the right methods. No `implements` keyword. If it has the methods, it fits.

**Why this changes how you design.** Because satisfaction is implicit, interfaces in Go are usually *tiny* - often a single method - and frequently defined by the *consumer*, not the producer. The most famous is `io.Writer`:
```go
type Writer interface {
	Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)
}
```
Anything with a `Write([]byte) (int, error)` method *is* an `io.Writer` - a file, a network connection, an in-memory buffer, an HTTP response - none of them ever mentioning the interface.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"strings"
)

func greet(w fmt.Stringer) { // any type with a String() string method fits
	fmt.Println(w.String())
}

type user struct{ name string }

func (u user) String() string { return "user: " + u.name }

func main() {
	greet(user{name: "Ada"}) // user satisfies fmt.Stringer just by having String()

	// And io.Writer in action: the same Fprintln targets a file or a buffer.
	var sb strings.Builder
	fmt.Fprintln(os.Stdout, "to the terminal")
	fmt.Fprintln(&sb, "to a buffer")
	fmt.Print(sb.String())
}
```
```console
$ go run main.go
user: Ada
to the terminal
to a buffer
```
`user` became a `fmt.Stringer` purely by having a `String()` method - we never declared the relationship. `fmt.Fprintln` wrote to two completely different destinations (the terminal and an in-memory `strings.Builder`) because both satisfy `io.Writer`. Small interfaces plus implicit satisfaction is why Go code composes so freely: you write to "anything that can be written to," and the caller picks what that is.

## Struct embedding: composition over inheritance

Go has no class inheritance. Instead, you *embed* one struct inside another by declaring it without a field name, and the outer struct gets the inner one's fields and methods promoted as its own - composition that *reads* like inheritance, without the hierarchy.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Engine struct{ Horsepower int }

func (e Engine) Start() { fmt.Println("vroom") }

type Car struct {
	Engine // embedded - no field name
	Brand  string
}

func main() {
	c := Car{Engine: Engine{Horsepower: 200}, Brand: "Tesla"}
	c.Start()                  // promoted from Engine
	fmt.Println(c.Horsepower)  // promoted field, no c.Engine.Horsepower needed
}
```
```console
$ go run main.go
vroom
200
```
`Car` embedded `Engine`, so `c.Start()` and `c.Horsepower` worked directly - the `Engine`'s method and field were *promoted* onto `Car`. There's no inheritance here: `Car` *has an* `Engine` and borrows its surface, composing pieces rather than building a tower of base classes.

## "Accept interfaces, return structs"

A widely-followed guideline: make function *parameters* interfaces (callers can pass anything that fits), but make *return values* concrete structs (callers get the real thing with all its methods).

**Why it works.** Accepting an interface keeps your function flexible - `func Save(w io.Writer, ...)` accepts a file, a buffer, a socket, anything writable. Returning a concrete struct keeps your *output* useful - the caller gets the full type and you're free to add methods later without breaking an interface contract. "Be liberal in what you accept, conservative in what you return," applied to types.

💡 **Key point.** When in doubt: parameters should be as *small and general* as the function needs (often a one-method interface); returns should be the *concrete* struct. Don't define an interface "just in case" - define it where it's *consumed*.

## `defer`: cleanup that can't be forgotten

`defer` schedules a function call to run when the *surrounding function* returns - no matter how (normal path, early `return`, or a panic) - guaranteeing cleanup sits right next to the thing that needs cleaning up.

**Why it's the idiom for cleanup.** You open something, then immediately `defer` closing it. The two lines live together, so you can't open-without-closing, or forget the close at the bottom of a long function with five early returns. Deferred calls run *last-in, first-out*, right for nested resources (close the inner thing before the outer).

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	defer fmt.Println("3. cleanup runs last")
	fmt.Println("1. start")
	fmt.Println("2. work")
}
```
```console
$ go run main.go
1. start
2. work
3. cleanup runs last
```
The `defer` was written *first* but ran *last* - Go held that call until `main` was about to return. This is why `defer f.Close()` right after `os.Open` ([Phase 7](07-errors-and-io.md)) is bulletproof: the close fires on the way out, even with a `return` or panic in between. Pair every "open / lock / acquire" with an immediate `defer` of its "close / unlock / release."

## The gotcha cheat-card

Skim these now so they're familiar when they happen; the notes below explain the two sharpest.

| Gotcha | What bites you | The fix |
|---|---|---|
| **A nil interface is not nil** | Returning a typed-but-nil pointer as an `error` makes `err != nil` true even though "there's no error" | Return a literal `nil` for the error, never a nil-valued concrete type held in an interface |
| **Slice `append` aliasing** | `append` may return a slice that *shares* the original's backing array, so writing to one silently changes the other | If you need independence, `copy` into a fresh slice (or append to a `nil`/fresh slice) |
| **Range loop variable capture (pre-1.22)** | In Go ≤1.21, goroutines/closures in a `for` loop all captured the *same* loop variable, seeing only its final value | Go **1.22+** fixed this (each iteration gets a fresh variable); on older Go, copy `v := v` inside the loop |
| **Unused imports / variables won't compile** | A leftover import or an unused local is a *compile error*, not a warning | Delete it - or use the blank identifier `_` deliberately for an intentionally-unused import |
| **Exported = Capitalized** | A lowercase name (`doThing`, `count`) is package-private; only `DoThing`, `Count` are visible to other packages | Capitalize the first letter to export; this *is* the visibility rule, there's no `public` keyword |
| **Zero values, not "undefined"** | An uninitialized variable isn't null/garbage - it's the type's *zero value* (`0`, `""`, `false`, `nil` for pointers/slices/maps) | Lean on it (`var count int` is a usable `0`); but ⚠️ a `nil` map can be *read* but panics if you *write* to it - `make` it first |

⚠️ **The nil-interface trap, explained.** Genuinely confusing the first time - worth slowing down for:
```go
package main

import "fmt"

type myError struct{}

func (e *myError) Error() string { return "boom" }

func doThing() error {
	var p *myError = nil // a nil pointer...
	return p             // ...returned as an error interface
}

func main() {
	err := doThing()
	fmt.Println(err == nil) // false!  - surprising
}
```
```console
$ go run main.go
false
```
An interface value carries *two* things: a type and a value. `doThing` returned a `*myError` that was nil - but the interface holds the *type* `*myError` plus a nil value, and an interface is only equal to `nil` when *both* parts are empty. So `err == nil` is `false` even though the underlying pointer is nil, and the caller's `if err != nil` wrongly thinks there was an error. Fix: return a *bare* `nil` when there's no error - never a nil-valued concrete type stuffed into the interface.

⚠️ **Slice append aliasing, explained.** A slice is a small header (pointer, length, capacity) over a backing array. `append` reuses that array when there's spare capacity - so two slices can quietly point at the same memory:
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	a := []int{1, 2, 3}
	b := a[:2]              // b shares a's backing array
	b = append(b, 99)      // capacity to spare → overwrites a[2] in place!
	fmt.Println(a)         // [1 2 99]  - a changed without you touching it
}
```
```console
$ go run main.go
[1 2 99]
```
`b := a[:2]` made `b` a window onto the same array as `a`, with room left over. `append(b, 99)` had spare capacity, so instead of allocating, it wrote `99` into the slot `a[2]` was using - mutating `a` as a side effect. When you need a slice you can grow without disturbing the original, copy the data into a fresh slice first.

📝 **Terminology.** A *zero value* is the default Go gives every variable you don't initialize - `0` for numbers, `""` for strings, `false` for bools, `nil` for pointers, slices, and maps. Go has no "uninitialized garbage" and no separate `null`; the zero value *is* the starting state, and good Go leans on it (an empty `sync.Mutex` is ready to use, a `nil` slice appends fine).

## Recap

1. **Interfaces are small and implicit** - satisfied automatically by having the methods; often one method, often defined by the consumer (`io.Writer`).
2. **Embedding, not inheritance** - compose structs by embedding; fields and methods get promoted.
3. **Accept interfaces, return structs** - flexible inputs, concrete outputs.
4. **`defer` for cleanup** - schedule the close/unlock right next to the open/lock; it runs on every exit path, LIFO.
5. **The cheat-card** - nil interface ≠ nil, slice append aliasing, range-var capture (fixed in 1.22), unused imports/vars are errors, exported = Capitalized, and zero values are real defaults (but don't write to a nil map).

That's idiomatic Go. You can now read other people's Go and write code that looks like it belongs. Next: where Go actually shines, what to build next, and where to go from here.
