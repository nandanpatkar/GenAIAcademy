# Logic Gates: Logic Made Physical

In Phase 1, AND, OR, and NOT were ideas - rules for combining `true` and `false`. They lived on
paper. This phase gives them a body.

The logic you learned isn't a metaphor for how computers work. It *is* how computers work. The
same three operations, soldered into silicon, are the entire foundation under everything your
machine does.

## What a gate actually is

A **logic gate** is a small physical component that takes one or two electrical signals as input
and produces one signal as output. That's it. No magic.

Inside a chip, a wire carries either a higher voltage or a lower one. We call the high voltage `1`
and the low voltage `0` (some designs flip this, but the principle holds). A wire is never "kind
of on" - it's exactly one of two states. That's the whole bridge: Phase 1's `true` and `false`
became `1` and `0`, and now those become voltages. A gate is a boolean operation you can hold in
your hand. When you think `A AND B`, a chip routes two voltages into an AND gate and reads what
comes out - the logic didn't change, it got physical.

## The basic gates

Three gates map directly onto the three operations you know. Each is fully described by its truth
table: list every possible input, write down the output, and you've captured everything the gate
does.

**AND** - output is `1` only when *both* inputs are `1`.

```text
A  B  | A AND B
0  0  |   0
0  1  |   0
1  0  |   0
1  1  |   1
```

**OR** - output is `1` when *at least one* input is `1`.

```text
A  B  | A OR B
0  0  |   0
0  1  |   1
1  0  |   1
1  1  |   1
```

**NOT** - takes a single input and flips it. The one gate with only one input.

```text
A  | NOT A
0  |   1
1  |   0
```

If these tables feel familiar, good - they're the same ones from
[the laws of boolean algebra](01-boolean-algebra-the-laws.md), now read as hardware.

## Derived gates

You build more useful gates by gluing the basics together. Three show up so often they get their
own names and symbols.

**NAND** - "not AND." Run AND, then flip the result. It outputs `0` only when both inputs are
`1`, and `1` in every other case.

```text
A  B  | A NAND B
0  0  |   1
0  1  |   1
1  0  |   1
1  1  |   0
```

**NOR** - "not OR." Run OR, then flip it. Outputs `1` only when both inputs are `0`.

```text
A  B  | A NOR B
0  0  |   1
0  1  |   0
1  0  |   0
1  1  |   0
```

**XOR** - "exclusive OR." Outputs `1` only when the inputs *differ* - one is `1` and the other is
`0`. If they match, the output is `0`. Think of it as asking "are these two things different?"

```text
A  B  | A XOR B
0  0  |   0
0  1  |   1
1  0  |   1
1  1  |   0
```

XOR is the workhorse behind addition and comparison. When a computer adds two bits, the "sum"
digit before carrying is exactly XOR. You'll see that in Phase 3.

> ⚠️ **XOR is not OR.** They agree on three of the four rows - the difference is the last one.
> Plain OR says "one or both," so `1 OR 1` is `1`. XOR says "one *or the other, not both*," so
> `1 XOR 1` is `0`. If you ever wonder which you want, ask: should "both true" count? OR says
> yes, XOR says no.

## Gate diagrams: how they wire together

The truth tables tell you what a gate does. A diagram shows how gates *talk* to each other. Here's a half-adder - the circuit that adds two single bits:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[A] --> AND[AND]
    A --> XOR[XOR]
    B[B] --> AND
    B --> XOR
    AND --> Cout[Cout]
    XOR --> Sum[Sum]
```

Two inputs, `A` and `B`, flow into both an AND gate and an XOR gate. AND produces the **carry-out**
(`Cout`) - `1` only when both inputs are `1`. XOR produces the **sum** (`Sum`) - `1` when the
inputs differ, exactly the "sum" digit before carrying in binary addition. This is the circuit
that lives inside every adder in your CPU; chain more gates and you get multi-bit addition.

## Universality: why NAND is special

Here's a result that sounds too good to be true: **the NAND gate, all by itself, can build every
other gate.** Give an engineer nothing but NAND gates and enough wire, and they can construct
AND, OR, NOT, XOR - the whole family (the same is true of NOR alone). This property is called
**functional completeness**: one building block, enough to express any boolean function.

The cleanest place to see it is NOT. Take a NAND gate and feed the *same* signal into both inputs.
Look at the rows where `A` and `B` are equal:

```text
A  A  | A NAND A
0  0  |    1
1  1  |    0
```

The output is the flip of the input - that's NOT, made from one NAND.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[A] --> NAND[NAND]
    A --> NAND
    NAND --> NOT[NOT output]
```

Once you have NOT, the rest follows. NAND is already "AND then flip," so flipping a NAND's output
(with another NAND wired as NOT) gives you back a plain **AND**. Getting **OR** takes more wiring,
but it's the same idea - chain NANDs until the truth table matches.

Why care? Building a chip from one repeated component is cheaper and easier to manufacture than
juggling many gate types, and real silicon leans on this hard. The deep idea you saw in
[what logic actually is](/guides/what-logic-actually-is) - that a few simple rules can express
enormous complexity - is the literal blueprint for a processor.

## For builders

You've met these gates already without knowing it. Most languages have **bitwise operators** that
apply a logic gate to *every bit of an integer at once*, in parallel:

- `&` is AND
- `|` is OR
- `^` is XOR
- `~` is NOT

When you write `5 & 3`, the computer writes both numbers in binary, lines up their bits, and runs
an AND gate on each column:

```text
  0101   (5)
& 0011   (3)
------
  0001   (1)
```

So `5 & 3` is `1`. Swap in `|` and you'd get `7` (`0111`); swap in `^` and you'd get `6` (`0110`).
The truth tables above are the *only* rules you need to predict the result - column by column, bit
by bit. The gates aren't an abstraction sitting above your code; they run underneath it.

## Recap

- A **logic gate** is a physical component that does one boolean operation on electrical
  signals, where high voltage means `1` and low means `0`.
- **AND, OR, NOT** are the basic gates - the Phase 1 operations, now in hardware.
- **NAND** and **NOR** are those gates with the output flipped; **XOR** outputs `1` only when
  its inputs *differ*.
- **NAND alone can build every other gate** (functional completeness) - start with NOT from a
  NAND with tied inputs, and the rest follows.
- The bitwise operators `&`, `|`, `^`, `~` are these gates run across all the bits of a number
  at once.

## Open-ended exercise

Sketch (in text or on paper) a circuit that uses AND, OR, and NOT gates to implement
this condition: `(A AND B) OR (NOT C)`. Then ask: if you only had NAND gates, could you
build the same circuit? Why or why not? (Hint: you already know NAND can make NOT, AND,
and OR.)
