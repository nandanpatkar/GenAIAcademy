# The Core Patterns

[Phase 1](01-everything-fails.md) showed a single slow dependency take down a whole service while nothing
technically crashed. This phase hands you the three tools that would have stopped it cold — simple enough
to hold in your head, and they work together:

- **Timeouts** decide *how long you're willing to wait* before giving up. (This is the one most systems
  are missing.)
- **Retries** decide *whether and how to try again* after a transient failure — carefully, with backoff
  and jitter, and only for operations that are safe to repeat.
- **Circuit breakers** decide *when to stop trying altogether* because the dependency is clearly broken
  — so you fail fast and let it recover instead of pounding on it.

Learn these three and you've covered the overwhelming majority of "my service fell over because of
something downstream" situations.

## Timeouts — never wait forever

**What it actually is.** A *timeout* is a deadline on a call: "if I don't get a response within N
seconds, stop waiting and treat it as a failure." It's the answer to the third outcome from Phase 1 — the
*hang* — by refusing to hang.

**Why people get this wrong.** Most libraries and HTTP clients ship with **no timeout, or a wildly
generous default** (sometimes effectively infinite). So the code that looks innocent —
`http.get(recommendations_url)` — is quietly a promise to wait *forever* if the other side never
answers. That's the exact mechanism that exhausted the worker pool in Phase 1.

**What it does in real life.** With a timeout, a slow dependency can hold a worker for *at most* the
timeout duration, not indefinitely — the worker comes back, free to serve someone else, and the slow
dependency degrades that one feature instead of starving the entire service.

```text
   No timeout:                        With a 1s timeout:

   call ──────────────────────▶ ???   call ───▶ (1s) ──▶ ✗ give up
        (worker stuck forever)                  worker freed, handle the failure
```

**A real example.** A timeout being hit, shown with `curl`'s max-time flag standing in for whatever your
client does:
```console
$ curl --max-time 2 https://recs.internal/recommend
curl: (28) Operation timed out after 2003 milliseconds with 0 bytes received
```
*What just happened:* `curl` waited two seconds, got nothing, and gave up with error 28 instead of
hanging indefinitely. In your service that translates to "the recommendations call failed; move on" —
maybe you skip recommendations and return the rest of the page. The worker is free again, and the slow
dependency cost you one feature for one request, not your whole service.

⚠️ **Gotcha — set timeouts at every layer, and budget them.** A timeout only protects the layer that has
one. If your outer request has a 30-second timeout but the database call inside it has none, the database
hang still wins. Inner timeouts should also *add up to less* than the outer one — if the overall request
must answer in 3 seconds, you can't give a sub-call 5. This is a **timeout budget**: the parent deadline
is divided among the children, not handed to each in full.

💡 **Key point.** If you do exactly one thing from this entire guide, set timeouts on every remote call.
It's the single highest-leverage line of defense, and the one most commonly missing.

## Retries — try again, but carefully

**What it actually is.** A *retry* is trying a failed call again, on the bet that the failure was
**transient** — a momentary blip, a packet drop, a brief overload — rather than permanent. Many network
failures genuinely are transient, so a retry often turns a glitch the user never sees into a non-event.

**Why people get this wrong — two ways, both bad.** First, **the naive retry loop**: fail, immediately
try again, fail, immediately try again. If the dependency is struggling because it's *overloaded*,
hammering it with instant retries pours gasoline on the fire. Worse, if *every* client retries at the
same instant, they all hit the recovering service together and knock it back down — a **thundering herd**.
The fix is two ideas stacked:

- **Exponential backoff** — wait longer between each attempt: 1s, then 2s, then 4s, then 8s. You give a
  struggling dependency room to breathe instead of crowding it.
- **Jitter** — add randomness to each wait so clients *don't* line up and retry in sync. Backoff spreads
  retries out in time; jitter spreads them out across *clients* (see AWS's
  ["Exponential Backoff And Jitter"](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/exponential-backoff-and-jitter/)).

```text
   Naive retry (everyone in lockstep):     Backoff + jitter (spread out):

   t=0  ✗✗✗✗✗  all clients retry at once    t≈1±r  ✗   ✗     ✗
   t=0  ✗✗✗✗✗  …again, in sync              t≈2±r    ✗    ✗  ✗
   t=0  ✗✗✗✗✗  …herd keeps stampeding       t≈4±r  ✗       ✗     ✗
        recovering service gets crushed             load is smeared across time
```

**A real example.**
```console
attempt 1: GET /recommend → 503 Service Unavailable   (wait ~1s + jitter)
attempt 2: GET /recommend → 503 Service Unavailable   (wait ~2s + jitter)
attempt 3: GET /recommend → 200 OK
```
*What just happened:* the first two attempts hit a temporarily overloaded service and got `503`. Instead
of retrying instantly, the client waited about a second (plus jitter), then about two, giving the service
room to recover. By the third attempt it was healthy again, and the user never saw an error.

The second way people get retries wrong is the dangerous one:

⚠️ **Gotcha — only retry idempotent operations.** An operation is **idempotent** if doing it twice has
the same effect as doing it once. Reading data is idempotent; setting a value to `X` is idempotent.
*Charging a credit card is not* — retry that blindly and you may bill the customer twice. The trap is the
*hang*: the request may have actually *succeeded* on the server, but the response got lost on the way
back, so the client thinks it failed and retries.

📝 **Terminology.** *Idempotent* = safe to repeat; the end state is the same no matter how many times you
do it. The safe pattern for non-idempotent actions (payments, "create order") is an **idempotency key** —
a unique ID the client sends so the server can recognize "I've already processed this one" and skip it.
This is the heart of reliable webhook delivery, covered in
[Webhooks & Message Queues](/guides/webhooks-and-message-queues) — read that before retrying anything
that *changes state*.

💡 **Key point.** Retries are for *transient* failures on *idempotent* operations. A `503` or a timeout
on a read? Retry with backoff and jitter. A `400 Bad Request` (your request is malformed) or a
`404`? Don't retry — the answer won't change, and you're just adding load. Retry the *retryable*, not
everything.

## Circuit breakers — stop hammering a corpse

Timeouts cap each call; retries handle the occasional blip. But what about when a dependency isn't
blipping — it's just *down*, and has been for a while? Retrying every single request, each waiting out
its full timeout first, is pure waste: you're spending your own resources waiting on something you
already have strong evidence is broken. That's where the circuit breaker comes in.

**What it actually is.** A *circuit breaker* is exactly the electrical metaphor: a switch that **trips
open** when it sees too much trouble, cutting the connection so the trouble can't spread. Once tripped,
calls **fail fast** — instantly, without even attempting the call — until enough time passes to check
whether it has recovered.

It lives in three states:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Closed["CLOSED<br/>normal calls, count failures"]
  Open["OPEN<br/>fail fast for a cooldown"]
  HalfOpen["HALF-OPEN<br/>let ONE test call through"]
  Closed -- "many failures in a row" --> Open
  Open -- "after a cooldown" --> HalfOpen
  HalfOpen -- "test succeeds" --> Closed
  HalfOpen -- "test fails (reopen)" --> Open
```

**What it does in real life.** When the dependency is healthy, the breaker is **closed** and traffic flows
normally while it quietly counts failures. When failures cross a threshold, it trips **open**: for the
next stretch of time (the cooldown), every call returns an error *immediately* without trying. After the
cooldown, it goes **half-open** and lets a single test call through — if that succeeds, the breaker closes
and normal traffic resumes; if it fails, the breaker opens again and waits another round.

**Why this saves you.** First, **fail fast**: when something's down, your users get a quick, honest error
(or a fallback — see [Phase 3](03-failing-soft.md)) instead of waiting out a timeout on every request.
Second, **let it recover**: a dependency struggling under load can't recover if you keep slamming it. The
open breaker takes the pressure off and protects *both* sides.

⚠️ **Gotcha — tune the thresholds, or the breaker lies.** A breaker that trips on one stray error flaps
open and closed, rejecting perfectly good traffic. One that needs a thousand failures won't protect you
in time. The right thresholds (how many failures, over what window, how long the cooldown) depend on your
traffic and take observation to get right — start conservative and adjust from what you see in production.

🪖 **War story.** The combination that bites people: a circuit breaker wrapped around a call that *also*
has aggressive retries *inside* the breaker. Each "attempt" is really three retried calls, so the
breaker's failure count and timing math are off by 3x and it never behaves as expected. Decide where
retries live relative to the breaker (usually: breaker outside, limited retries within a single logical
attempt) and keep it consistent.

## How the three fit together

These aren't three separate tools you pick between — they're layers on the *same* call:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Call([outbound call]) --> CB{Circuit breaker open?}
  CB -- "open" --> Fast[fail fast, don't even try]
  CB -- "closed" --> Retry["Retry (idempotent only)<br/>backoff + jitter"]
  Retry --> Timeout["Timeout<br/>cap each attempt"]
  Timeout --> Net[the actual network call]
```

A call goes out; the **timeout** caps how long each attempt can take; **retries** handle a transient
failure with backoff and jitter; and the **circuit breaker** sits over the whole thing, ready to trip and
fail fast if the dependency is clearly broken. Timeouts make retries safe — a hung call can't block a
retry. Retries make blips invisible. The breaker stops the bleeding when blips become an outage.

## Recap

1. **Timeouts** cap how long you'll wait — set them on *every* remote call, at every layer, with inner
   timeouts adding up to less than outer ones (a timeout budget). The most commonly missing safeguard.
2. **Retries** handle *transient* failures, but only with **exponential backoff** and **jitter**, so you
   don't stampede a recovering service.
3. **Retry only idempotent operations** — anything that changes state needs an **idempotency key**; see
   [Webhooks & Message Queues](/guides/webhooks-and-message-queues).
4. A **circuit breaker** trips **open** after too many failures, **fails fast** during a cooldown, then
   tests recovery in **half-open** — protecting both your resources and the struggling dependency.
5. The three layer onto the same call: breaker outside, retries within an attempt, timeout on each call.
