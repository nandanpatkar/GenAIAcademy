# Mapping Objects to Tables

[Phase 1](01-what-an-orm-is.md) named the four jobs an ORM does. This phase is the first and most
foundational one: **mapping**. Before an ORM can track your changes or build a query, it has to know one
thing — *which object goes with which row*. Everything else builds on that answer.

Here's the mental model to hold the whole way through: **mapping is a small set of correspondence rules.**
Not magic, and not a lot of rules — the ORM looks at your classes and your schema and lines them up,
piece by piece, following the same handful of correspondences every time. Internalize those rules and you
can predict what *any* ORM will do with *any* class, and the SQL it'll generate.

## The correspondence rules

Five rules cover almost everything you'll meet:

- a **class ↔ a table** — `User` lines up with the `users` table.
- a **field / property ↔ a column** — `user.email` lines up with the `email` column.
- a **primary key field ↔ the PK column** — usually an `id` field maps to the `id` primary key.
- an **object reference ↔ a foreign key** — `order.customer` (a pointer to another object) lines up with `orders.customer_id` (a foreign key column).
- a **collection ↔ a one-to-many** — `customer.orders` (a list of objects) lines up with many rows in `orders` that share the same `customer_id`. And the special case: a **many-to-many ↔ a join table**.

The first three are "shape of one thing" rules. The last two are the interesting ones, because that's
where the [object-relational mismatch](01-what-an-orm-is.md) really bites: your code holds a *reference*
(a direct pointer from one object to another), but the database has no pointers — only foreign keys,
columns holding the *value* of some other row's primary key. The ORM's job is to fake the pointer using
the key.

## Seeing the rules on real classes

Say you have a `Customer` that owns a list of `Order` objects, and each `Order` points back to its
`Customer`. Here's the mapping the ORM applies, in pseudocode:

```text
class Customer:                       table customers:
    id                       ↔            id           (PK)
    name                     ↔            name
    orders  -> [Order]       ↔            (no column — lives in orders)

class Order:                          table orders:
    id                       ↔            id           (PK)
    total                    ↔            total
    customer -> Customer     ↔            customer_id  (FK -> customers.id)
```

*What just happened:* The scalar fields (`name`, `total`) became plain columns. `Order.customer` became
the `customer_id` foreign key — the one column that actually stores the relationship. `Customer.orders`
has *no column at all* — it's the *reverse view* of that same foreign key. Ask for `customer.orders` and
the ORM runs `SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = ?`. One relationship, one foreign key, seen from
two directions.

Many-to-many is the case where neither side can hold the key — a student takes many courses, a course has
many students, and there's nowhere to put a single `course_id` on `students`. So the ORM introduces a
third table:

```text
class Student:        class Course:           join table enrollments:
    courses  ──────────── students    ↔          student_id  (FK -> students.id)
                                                  course_id   (FK -> courses.id)
```

*What just happened:* The `enrollments` join table holds one row per (student, course) pairing.
`student.courses` and `course.students` are *both* reverse views into that table — the ORM reads it from
whichever side you asked. You typically never write a class for `enrollments`; the ORM manages it behind
the collection. (If the relationship needs its own data — say, an enrollment *date* — most ORMs make you
promote it to a real class; see [Relationships & Keys](/guides/relationships-and-keys).)

> 💡 If a relationship ever confuses you, find the foreign key. The FK is the source of truth; the object reference and the collection are two convenient views of it. "Which table has the `_id` column?" answers "who owns this relationship?"

## Convention, then configuration

How does the ORM *know* that `Customer` maps to `customers` and `Order.customer` maps to `customer_id`?
Two layers, true of every ORM:

1. **Convention** — sensible defaults inferred from your names and types. Class `Customer` → table
   `customers` (pluralized, lowercased). Field `email` → column `email`. A reference named `customer` →
   foreign key `customer_id`. You write nothing; the defaults carry you a long way.
2. **Configuration** — explicit overrides for when the defaults don't fit: a legacy table named
   `tbl_cust`, a column called `email_address`, a key that isn't `id`. You annotate the mapping to
   correct it.

The *idea* is identical across the ecosystem; only the syntax differs:

- **Hibernate / JPA** (Java) — annotations on the class: `@Entity`, `@Table(name=...)`, `@Column`, `@ManyToOne`, `@JoinColumn`.
- **SQLAlchemy** (Python) — declarative models: a class subclasses a base, columns are class attributes, relationships use `relationship()`.
- **GORM** (Go) — struct tags: `gorm:"column:email_address"` right on the struct field.
- **EF Core** (C#) — conventions plus the **Fluent API** (`modelBuilder.Entity<...>().Property(...)`) or data attributes.

> 💡 Reach for configuration only to *correct* a convention the ORM got wrong — not to restate one it
> already got right. Re-declaring `@Column(name = "email")` on a field already named `email` is noise.
> The less you configure, the more readable the mapping, and the easier it is to spot genuine deviations.

## The sharpest edge: inheritance

Here's where the mismatch cuts deepest. Your classes can *inherit* — `SavingsAccount` and
`CheckingAccount` both extend `Account`. SQL has no concept of inheritance: a table is a flat list of
columns, there's no "this table extends that one." So the ORM has to *choose a strategy* to flatten a
class hierarchy into tables, and each choice is a real tradeoff:

- **Single-table** — one table for the whole hierarchy, with a **discriminator column** (e.g.
  `account_type`) saying which subclass each row is. Subclass-only columns are nullable for other rows.
  Fast queries (no joins), but a wide table full of nulls.
- **Joined / table-per-subclass** — a base table (`accounts`) plus one table per subclass
  (`savings_accounts`, `checking_accounts`), linked by sharing the primary key. Clean and normalized, but
  loading a subclass means a **join** on every read.
- **Table-per-class** — each concrete class gets its own standalone table with *all* its columns
  (inherited ones copied in). No joins for a single type, but "all accounts regardless of type" forces a
  `UNION` across every table.

The tradeoff in one line: **single-table buys query speed with nullable clutter; joined buys
normalization with extra joins; table-per-class buys per-type simplicity with painful cross-type
queries.** Most teams reach for single-table unless the hierarchy is wide or the nulls become genuinely
misleading. Know that the ORM is making this choice on your behalf, and that the strategy you pick shows
up directly in the SQL you'll later debug.

## Mapping runs both directions

> 📝 Mapping is **bidirectional**. On *load*, the ORM goes **row → object**: it reads a row and pours the
> column values into a fresh object's fields — this is called **hydration**. On *save*, it runs the
> reverse — **object → row** — reading your object's fields and writing them out as `INSERT` or `UPDATE`
> column values.

The same correspondence rules drive both directions — that's the point of having rules instead of
hand-written code. Hydration is also where foreign keys get turned *back* into references: when the ORM
hydrates an `Order` and sees `customer_id = 42`, it knows `order.customer` should resolve to the
`Customer` with id 42 (whether it fetches that customer now or later is the *loading* job, coming in a
later phase).

This load/save round-trip is why the relationship modeling in [Relationships & Keys](/guides/relationships-and-keys)
matters so much: the ORM can only hydrate references and collections correctly if the foreign keys it's
reading are sound. Get the keys right in the schema, and the mapping rules do the rest, in both
directions, every time.

## Recap

- **Mapping is a small, fixed set of correspondence rules** — learn them once and you can predict any ORM's behavior and its SQL.
- The core five: **class ↔ table**, **field ↔ column**, **PK field ↔ PK column**, **object reference ↔ foreign key**, **collection ↔ one-to-many** (with **many-to-many ↔ a join table**).
- An object **reference** and a **collection** are two views of the *same* foreign key; the FK is the source of truth for who owns a relationship.
- ORMs map by **convention** (defaults from names/types) plus **configuration** (annotations / declarative models / struct tags / Fluent API) — configure only to override what the convention got wrong.
- **Inheritance** has no SQL equivalent, so the ORM picks a strategy — **single-table**, **joined**, or **table-per-class** — each trading query speed against normalization.
- Mapping is **bidirectional**: **hydration** turns rows into objects on load; the reverse turns objects into rows on save.
