# What a Database Actually Is

You've probably saved data in a spreadsheet, a text file, maybe a folder of files named `final_v2_REALLY_final.xlsx`. It works — until it doesn't. Two people open the same file and one overwrites the other. A typo turns a price into nonsense and nothing stops it. The file grows to a million rows and finding one customer takes forever. Somewhere in that frustration is the exact moment a database starts to make sense.

This guide is the "A" of databases — the part nobody slows down to explain. By the end you'll know what a database *actually is* (not the dictionary version), why it's more than a bigger spreadsheet, how its data is shaped, and how your app talks to it. No queries to memorize yet — a clear mental model first, so the rest of your database life makes sense on its own.

## How to read this
- **Want a quick gut-check** on whether you even need a database? Read [Phase 1: More Than a Spreadsheet](01-more-than-a-spreadsheet.md) — that's the whole "why."
- **Want it to finally make sense?** Read in order — each phase builds on the last, from *what it is* to *how it's shaped* to *how you talk to it*.

## The phases
1. **[More Than a Spreadsheet](01-more-than-a-spreadsheet.md)** — what a database *actually is*: organized data **plus** a program (the DBMS) that manages access, integrity, and many users at once — and why files and spreadsheets eventually fail you.
2. **[Tables, Rows, Columns & Keys](02-tables-rows-columns-keys.md)** — the relational model in plain terms: tables, rows, columns with types, the schema (the agreed shape), and the one idea that ties it together — the key.
3. **[The Database vs Your App](03-the-database-vs-your-app.md)** — the database is a separate server you talk to over a connection, using a language called SQL — and a quick map of the wider landscape.

> Deliberately deferred to follow-up guides: actually *writing* queries (`SELECT … WHERE …`) lives in [/guides/querying-basics-select-where](/guides/querying-basics-select-where), and the relational-vs-everything-else debate lives in [/guides/sql-vs-nosql](/guides/sql-vs-nosql). This guide gets you to the door; those walk you through it.
