# The N+1 Query Problem

You shipped a page. It flew on your laptop with ten rows of seed data. Then production filled up, and the same page started taking four seconds, then eight, then timing out — and nothing in your code changed. The bug was there the whole time, hiding behind a line that looked completely innocent. This guide shows you exactly what that line does, how to see it, and the three ways to fix it.

## How to read this

Read it in order, once, start to finish. Phase 1 builds the mental model so the rest stops feeling like magic. Phase 2 is the day-job skill: seeing the extra queries in your own logs. Phase 3 is the fix, plus the tradeoff nobody warns you about. The examples are deliberately plain — the trap is the same whether you write Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, or JavaScript, so don't get hung up on one ORM's spelling.

## The phases

1. [What N+1 actually is](01-what-n-plus-one-is.md) — the mental model: one query, then one more per row.
2. [Seeing it in your logs](02-seeing-it-in-the-logs.md) — how to catch it red-handed with query logs and APM.
3. [Fixing it without over-fetching](03-fixing-it.md) — eager loading, the single JOIN, batching, and the tradeoff.
