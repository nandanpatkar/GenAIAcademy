# SQL vs NoSQL, Honestly

You've probably watched this argument play out. One person swears relational databases are
the only serious choice; another insists NoSQL is the modern way and SQL is a relic. Both
sound confident, both have battle scars, and you're left wondering which side is right for
*your* app — usually under deadline pressure, picking a database you'll live with for years.

Here's the honest answer up front: this isn't a fight with a winner. "SQL" and "NoSQL" name
two different *shapes* of data store, each tuned for different problems. The skill isn't
picking the "best" one — it's recognizing which shape fits the problem in front of you. This
guide gives you the mental models and the real trade-offs so you can choose on purpose, not on
hype.

## How to read this

- **Need the decision now?** Jump to [Phase 3: How to Actually Choose](03-how-to-choose.md) —
  it leads with a plain-language picker and the two warnings that catch people.
- **Want it to finally make sense?** Read in order. Phase 1 builds the mental models, Phase 2
  lays out the honest trade-offs, and Phase 3 turns those into a decision you can defend.

## The phases

1. **[The Relational Model & What "NoSQL" Even Means](01-the-models.md)** — what "relational"
   actually is (tables, relationships, SQL), and why "NoSQL" is an umbrella over four very
   different families: document, key-value, wide-column, and graph.
2. **[The Honest Trade-offs](02-the-trade-offs.md)** — schema flexibility vs enforced
   integrity, joins vs denormalization, consistency vs horizontal scale, and query power vs
   raw speed — laid out fairly, both sides.
3. **[How to Actually Choose](03-how-to-choose.md)** — the boring-correct default, when to
   reach for a specific NoSQL store, and the two traps ("NoSQL ≠ no schema" and "you can mix").

> This guide is about *choosing* between the families. The deep mechanics of any one store —
> how to design Mongo documents well, how to tune a wide-column key, how to model a graph —
> are big enough to deserve their own guides, and we deliberately leave them there.
