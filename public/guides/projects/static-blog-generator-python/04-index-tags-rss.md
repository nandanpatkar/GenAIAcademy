# The Index, Tags, and an RSS Feed

You have pages, but no front door. A visitor landing on your site right now gets a directory listing, which says "file server," not "blog." This phase generates the three kinds of *derived* pages - pages built not from one post but from knowledge of **all** posts: the index, per-tag pages, and an RSS feed. This is also the phase where you'll feel exactly where a four-line template engine stops being enough, which is a lesson worth having in your bones.

## The index - and the wall our engine hits

The front page is a heading plus a list of links, newest first. Create `templates/index.html`:

```html
<h1>{{ heading }}</h1>
<ul class="post-list">
{{ items }}
</ul>
```

Notice what this template *doesn't* do: it doesn't loop over posts. It can't. Our `render()` replaces placeholders; it has no concept of "repeat this bit for each item." A real engine would write `{% for post in posts %}` right in the template - that loop syntax is precisely what Jinja2 sells.

Our honest workaround: build the repeated part in Python, where loops live, and hand the finished block to the template as one value:

```python
def post_list_items(posts):
    items = []
    for post in posts:
        items.append(
            f'<li><a href="/{post["slug"]}.html">{post["title"]}</a>'
            f' <span class="date">{post["date"]:%Y-%m-%d}</span></li>'
        )
    return "\n".join(items)
```

💡 **Key point:** this is the line where you now know *when* to reach for Jinja2 - the moment your templates need repetition or conditionals, not before. Until then, an engine you fully understand beats one you don't. For a blog this size, the workaround costs eight lines.

The template takes a `heading` instead of hardcoding "All posts" for a reason that pays off immediately: tag pages are the *same shape* - a heading and a list of posts - so one template serves both.

## Tag pages

A tag page is "the index, filtered." The build collects a mapping of tag → posts, then renders the index template once per tag into `site/tags/<tag>.html`:

```python
    tags = {}
    for post in posts:
        for tag in post["tags"]:
            tags.setdefault(tag, []).append(post)
```

`setdefault(tag, [])` means "give me the list for this tag, creating an empty one first if it's new" - the standard idiom for building a dict of lists without checking `if tag in tags` every time.

⚠️ **Gotcha:** the tag becomes a *filename*. `tags: web dev` would produce `site/tags/web dev.html` - a URL with a space in it, which works but looks broken and gets percent-encoded into `web%20dev`. Keep tags to single lowercase words (`python`, `web`, `meta`). Slugifying multi-word tags properly is on the extensions list in phase 6.

## The RSS feed

**What RSS actually is.** A machine-readable table of contents for your site: one XML file listing your recent posts with titles, links, and dates. Feed readers and other sites poll it to learn you've published. It's the oldest open "subscribe" mechanism on the web, it never died, and a blog without one is invisible to the people most likely to actually follow you.

An RSS document looks like this - a `<channel>` describing the site, containing `<item>`s describing posts:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<rss version="2.0">
<channel>
  <title>My Blog</title>
  <link>https://example.com</link>
  <description>Posts from my hand-built blog.</description>
  <item>
    <title>Why I Went Static</title>
    <link>https://example.com/2026-07-02-why-static-sites.html</link>
    <guid>https://example.com/2026-07-02-why-static-sites.html</guid>
    <pubDate>Thu, 02 Jul 2026 00:00:00 -0000</pubDate>
  </item>
</channel>
</rss>
```

Two details in there are where hand-rolled feeds usually go wrong, and the standard library has the answer to both:

- **`pubDate` must be RFC 822 format** - `Thu, 02 Jul 2026 00:00:00 -0000`, the ancient email date style. Don't hand-format it; `email.utils.format_datetime()` exists precisely because this format is fussy (English day names, specific ordering, a zone offset).
- **Titles must be XML-escaped.** Browsers forgive broken HTML; XML parsers do not. One post titled `Cats & Dogs` with a raw `&` makes the *entire feed* invalid, and every subscriber's reader silently stops updating. `xml.sax.saxutils.escape()` converts `&`, `<`, and `>` into their safe entities.

📝 **Terminology:** `<guid>` is the item's permanent unique identifier - readers use it to remember which items you've already seen. Using the post's URL as its guid is the standard move.

## The complete build.py

This is the full file as it stands at the end of this phase - everything above `post_list_items` is unchanged from phase 3:

```python

def parse_post(path):

    if not text.startswith("---"):
        raise ValueError(f"{path.name}: no frontmatter block at the top")
    _, front, body = text.split("---", 2)

    meta = {}
    for line in front.strip().splitlines():
        key, _, value = line.partition(":")
        meta[key.strip()] = value.strip()

    return {
        "title": meta.get("title", path.stem),
        "date": datetime.strptime(meta["date"], "%Y-%m-%d"),

        )

    )


def build():
    if SITE_DIR.exists():
        shutil.rmtree(SITE_DIR)
    SITE_DIR.mkdir()
    shutil.copy(STATIC_DIR / "style.css", SITE_DIR / "style.css")

    base = load_template("base.html")
    post_template = load_template("post.html")
    index_template = load_template("index.html")

    posts = [parse_post(p) for p in sorted(POSTS_DIR.glob("*.md"))]
    posts.sort(key=lambda p: p["date"], reverse=True)

    # one page per post
    for post in posts:
        article = render(post_template, {
            "title": post["title"],
            "date": pretty_date(post["date"]),
            "tags": ", ".join(post["tags"]),
            "body": post["html"],
        })

        "items": post_list_items(posts),
    })

    write_page("index.html", page)

    # one page per tag
    tags = {}
    for post in posts:
        for tag in post["tags"]:
            tags.setdefault(tag, []).append(post)
    for tag, tagged in sorted(tags.items()):
        listing = render(index_template, {
            "heading": f'Posts tagged "{tag}"',
            "items": post_list_items(tagged),
        })
        page = render(base, {"title": f"Tag: {tag}", "content": listing})
        write_page(f"tags/{tag}.html", page)

    # the feed
    write_page("feed.xml", build_feed(posts))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    build()
```

A few deliberate choices to notice:

- `posts[:10]` in the feed - RSS convention is recent posts, not your life's work. Readers that want the archive have the site.
- The feed reuses the already-sorted `posts` list, so items come out newest-first, which is what readers expect.
- Tag pages sort alphabetically (`sorted(tags.items())`) so rebuilds are deterministic - the same input always produces byte-identical output, which makes diffs of `site/` meaningful.

## Run it

```console
(.venv) $ python build.py
built  site/2026-07-02-why-static-sites.html
built  site/2026-06-28-hello-world.html
built  site/index.html
built  site/tags/meta.html
built  site/tags/web.html
built  site/feed.xml
```

Serve it again - `python -m http.server 8000 --directory site` - and open `http://localhost:8000`. No more directory listing: your front page lists both posts, newest on top, and each link works. Try `http://localhost:8000/tags/web.html` - only the post tagged `web` appears. And `http://localhost:8000/feed.xml` shows the feed (some browsers render XML as a collapsible tree; that's the browser being helpful, the bytes are yours).

*What just happened:* the build now produces every kind of page a small blog needs - six files from two posts, all derived from the same parsed data, all regenerated from scratch in a fraction of a second.

## What you have now

A complete blog: posts, a front page, tag archives, and a subscribable feed. The remaining friction is workflow - that build-serve-refresh dance every time you edit. Phase 5 collapses it into "save the file, refresh the browser."
