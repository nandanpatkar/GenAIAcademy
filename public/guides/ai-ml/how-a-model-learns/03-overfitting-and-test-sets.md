# Overfitting & Why Test Sets Exist

By now you know training drives the loss down, lap after lap. So here's an uncomfortable question: if lower
loss is better, why not keep training until the loss is nearly zero? Wouldn't that be a perfect model?

It would be a model that's perfect *on the examples it has already seen* — and possibly useless on
anything new. That trap has a name, and avoiding it is the reason machine learning has the rituals it
does. This phase delivers the difference between a model that *memorized* and one that actually
*learned*.

## Memorizing vs. generalizing

**What it actually is.** There are two ways for loss to get low. The model can learn the genuine
underlying pattern (good), or it can memorize the specific answers to the specific examples it was shown
(bad). Both make training loss small. Only the first is worth anything.

📝 **Terminology.** **Generalizing** means the model performs well on *new* inputs it never saw during
training — it grasped the pattern. **Overfitting** is the opposite: the model latched onto the quirks
and noise of the training examples themselves, so it aces them and stumbles on everything else.

**Why people get this wrong.** It's tempting to read "low loss = good model." But low *training* loss
only tells you the model fits the data it studied. A student who memorized last year's exam answer key
gets 100% on last year's exam and learned nothing. ⚠️ **Overfitting is acing the training data and
failing reality** — and it's invisible if the only thing you ever measure is performance on the data the
model trained on.

        |   ._.--                                 |   ._/      \
        |_.--__________ size                      |_/__________ size

   captures the real pattern;               wiggles through every example,
   handles new houses well                  including the noise — fails on new ones
```

## The fix: keep some data hidden

**What it actually is.** Before training starts, you split your data into separate piles and only let
the model *learn* from one of them. The others are held back specifically to test it on data it has
never seen — the only honest measure of whether it generalized.

📝 **Terminology — the three piles.**

| Pile | What it's for | Does the model train on it? |
|---|---|---|
| **Training set** | The examples the model learns from (runs the Phase 2 loop on). | Yes |
| **Validation set** | A check used *during* development to tune choices and spot overfitting early. | No |
| **Test set** | A final, untouched exam taken once, to estimate real-world performance. | No |

**Why the split exists.** It's the whole point: measuring a model on the data it trained on tells you
nothing about the future, the same way grading a student on the answer key they memorized tells you
nothing about whether they understand. The held-back data is new to the model, so its score on that data
is a fair stand-in for how it'll do on the genuinely new inputs it'll meet in the real world.

**A real example.**

```text
   Training set:    loss is low      ──►  model fits what it studied
   Test set:        loss is low      ──►  it GENERALIZED   ✓  ship it

   ...vs the bad case...

   Training set:    loss is low      ──►  fits what it studied
   Test set:        loss is high     ──►  it OVERFIT       ✗  memorized, didn't learn
```

*What just happened:* The gap between the two scores is the tell. When a model does great on training
data but poorly on the held-back test data, that gap *is* overfitting, made visible. Without a hidden
pile of data, you'd never see it coming — you'd ship a model that looked perfect and fell apart in
production.

**The gotcha.** ⚠️ The test set only stays honest if you keep it sealed. The moment you start tweaking
your model to score better on the test set, it stops being "data the model never saw" and you're
quietly overfitting to it too. That's exactly why the validation set exists as a separate pile: you tune
against validation and save the test set for one final, honest look.

## A model is only as good as its data

**What it actually is.** Everything the model knows came from its training examples — and *only* from
them. If those examples are skewed, incomplete, or carry human bias, the model learns the skew right
along with the pattern. It has no other source of truth.

**What it does in real life.** A hiring model trained mostly on one group's résumés learns that group's
patterns and quietly disadvantages others. A model trained only on daytime photos struggles at night.
The model isn't being malicious or careless — it's faithfully reflecting the data it was handed.
"Garbage in, garbage out" is not a warning about the algorithm; it's a fact about where the weights came
from.

**Why this matters.** This is the most important honesty in the whole guide: a model's fairness and blind
spots are inherited from its data, not invented by the math. The data side of that story — where bias creeps
in and what to watch for — is covered in [ML Basics for Data People](/guides/ml-basics-for-data-people).

**Why this saves you later.** When a model behaves strangely — great in the demo, wrong in the wild;
fair for some users, unfair for others — your first question is now the right one: *what was it trained
on, and what was missing?* That instinct will serve you far better than assuming the model is plainly
"smart" or "broken."

## Recap

1. Low *training* loss isn't enough — a model can **memorize (overfit)** instead of learning the real
   pattern.
2. We split data into **training**, **validation**, and **test** sets so we can measure the model on
   data it never learned from.
3. A big gap between training performance and test performance is **overfitting**, made visible.
4. A model **inherits the biases and gaps of its data** — it has no other source of truth.

## So, what is training, really?

Strip away the mystique and here's the whole thing: **training is tuning a big pile of numbers until a
fixed recipe's guesses match examples we already have answers for — then checking, on data it never saw,
that it learned the pattern instead of memorizing the answers.**

That's it. Powerful, genuinely useful, occasionally surprising — but not magic. A patient walk
downhill, an honest exam at the end, and numbers that are only ever as good as the examples that shaped
them.
