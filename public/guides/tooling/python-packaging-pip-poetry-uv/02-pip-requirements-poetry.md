# The Daily Driver: pip, requirements, and Poetry

You've got the model: each project gets its own shelf, and you keep the *recipe* in git. This phase is about writing that recipe well. We'll start where almost everyone starts - `pip` and a `requirements.txt` - see exactly where that recipe falls short, and then move to `pyproject.toml` with Poetry, which fixes the gaps without changing the model underneath.

## pip and requirements.txt: the honest baseline

Inside an activated environment, `pip install` puts a package on the shelf. To make that repeatable, you write down what you installed. The classic way is a plain text file:

```text
# requirements.txt
requests
flask
```

```console
(.venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*What just happened:* pip read the file line by line and installed each named package - and, quietly, the latest compatible version of each, *plus* every library those packages themselves depend on. That last part matters: `flask` pulls in a half-dozen other packages you never named.

Now the gap. Your file says `flask` with no version. Install it today and you get one version; install it next year and you get a newer one that might behave differently. The recipe isn't reproducible - it's a wish. The common patch is `pip freeze`:

```console
(.venv) $ pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

```text
# requirements.txt after freeze
certifi==2024.2.2
charset-normalizer==3.3.2
click==8.1.7
flask==3.0.2
requests==2.31.0
...
```

*What just happened:* `pip freeze` dumped *every* package on the shelf with its exact version - including all the indirect dependencies you never asked for. Now the install is reproducible. But you've created a new problem: this flat list can't tell you which packages you actually chose (`flask`, `requests`) and which are just along for the ride. When you want to remove `flask`, you can't know which of those other lines are safe to delete. There's no record of *intent*, only of *result*.

That's the core limitation of `requirements.txt`: it's a single flat list that conflates "what I want" with "what that dragged in," and on its own it doesn't separate your runtime needs from your test-only tools either.

> `requirements.txt` is not dead - it's a fine, dependency-light format for simple scripts, container builds, and deployment targets that expect it. The trouble starts when a project grows and you need to reason about *why* each package is there.

## pyproject.toml: declaring intent

The modern Python recipe is a file called `pyproject.toml`. It's a standardized config file (defined across several PEPs) that declares what your project *is* and what it *directly* depends on - your intent, separate from the resolved result.

```toml
# pyproject.toml
[project]
name = "billing-service"
version = "0.1.0"
requires-python = ">=3.10"
dependencies = [
    "requests>=2.31",
    "flask>=3.0",
]
```

*What just happened:* you declared the two libraries you actually chose, with version *floors* (`>=`), and which Python versions the project supports. Nothing about `certifi` or `click` - those are consequences, recorded elsewhere, not intent. This is the recipe a human reads to understand the project.

But `pyproject.toml` declares intent; it doesn't, by itself, *pin* the exact resolved versions for reproducibility, and standard tooling won't manage the environment for you. That's the job a project manager fills. Poetry is the long-established one.

## Poetry: intent plus a lockfile, in one tool

Poetry reads and writes `pyproject.toml`, creates and manages the virtual environment for you, resolves the full dependency tree, and - the key part - records the exact resolution in a `poetry.lock` file.

```console
$ poetry new billing-service        # scaffold a project, or `poetry init` in an existing one
$ cd billing-service
$ poetry add requests flask         # adds to pyproject.toml AND installs AND updates the lock
$ poetry add --group dev pytest     # a dev-only dependency, kept out of production installs
```

*What just happened:* `poetry add` did three things at once - wrote the dependency into `pyproject.toml`, installed it into a managed virtual environment, and updated `poetry.lock` with the precise versions of everything in the resolved tree. The `--group dev` flag put `pytest` in a separate bucket, so your production install can skip test tooling entirely. That dependency-group split is exactly the "which packages are along for the ride / which are test-only" problem that flat `requirements.txt` couldn't express.

The lockfile is the payoff. `pyproject.toml` says "Flask 3.x or newer"; `poetry.lock` says "this exact build of Flask 3.0.2, and these exact 14 other packages, with these hashes." Two files, two jobs:

```text
pyproject.toml   →  human intent, version RANGES, hand-edited, committed
poetry.lock      →  machine resolution, exact PINS + hashes, tool-generated, committed
```

*What just happened:* the split solves the `requirements.txt` confusion cleanly. You read and edit the ranges; the tool owns the pins. Commit both. To reproduce the exact environment anywhere, one command reads the lock:

```console
$ poetry install        # builds the environment from poetry.lock - identical every time
$ poetry run pytest     # run a command inside the managed environment, no manual activate
```

*What just happened:* `poetry install` rebuilt the shelf to match the lockfile exactly - same versions on your machine, your teammate's, and CI. `poetry run` executed a command inside that environment without you having to activate it. This is the literal cure for "works on my machine": everyone resolves to the same locked versions instead of each grabbing whatever is newest that day.

## In the wild

A healthy repo commits `pyproject.toml` and the lockfile, and git-ignores `.venv`. A new contributor clones, runs one install command, and gets a byte-for-byte reproduction of everyone else's dependencies. The flow is: edit ranges in `pyproject.toml` (or via `poetry add`), let the tool re-resolve and re-lock, commit both files. Nobody hand-edits the lockfile, and nobody commits the environment.
