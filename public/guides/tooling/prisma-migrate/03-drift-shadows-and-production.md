# Drift, shadows, and production

The everyday loop is smooth until someone reaches into the database by hand, or a migration half-fails in production, or two people generate migrations on the same day. This phase is about those moments - the ones that turn a calm Tuesday into an incident. None of them are mysterious once you understand what Prisma is checking and why.

## The shadow database, demystified

When `migrate dev` generates a migration, it needs to answer a sharp question: *does the recorded migration history actually produce the schema I wrote?* To check this without touching your real dev data, Prisma spins up a temporary, throwaway database - the **shadow database** - replays every migration into it from scratch, and compares the result against your schema.

```console
$ npx prisma migrate dev --name add_index

Prisma needs to create a shadow database...
Replaying migrations into shadow database...
Comparing against schema.prisma...

The following migration(s) have been created and applied:
  └─ 20260630140000_add_index/
```

*What just happened:* Prisma built a clean database, ran your whole migration history into it, and used that as a trustworthy reference point to compute the diff for the new migration. It's created and dropped automatically. The shadow database is *only* used by `migrate dev` - `migrate deploy` never needs one, which is good, because production database users often can't create databases.

> If your dev database user lacks permission to create a database, the shadow step fails. The fix is to point Prisma at a separate shadow database you provision yourself, via the `shadowDatabaseUrl` field in your `datasource` block. This is common on hosted Postgres where your user can't create databases.

## Drift detection: when reality diverges

**Drift** is when the actual database no longer matches what the migration history says it should be. Someone added a column in a SQL console, or restored an old backup, or edited a migration after it ran. `migrate dev` catches this and refuses to proceed quietly:

```console
$ npx prisma migrate dev

Drift detected: Your database schema is not in sync with your migration history.

[+] Added column `phone` to table `User`
```

*What just happened:* Prisma replayed history into the shadow database, compared it to your real database, and found a column in reality that no migration ever created. It stops rather than generating a migration on top of an unknown state. In development, the resolution is usually to let Prisma reset and reapply (you'll lose dev data), or to fold that manual change into a proper migration so history tells the truth again.

## The one rule: never edit an applied migration

Here is the rule that protects the whole system: **once a migration has been applied anywhere real, never change its `migration.sql`.**

Why? Because Prisma records a checksum of each migration in `_prisma_migrations`. On the next `migrate deploy`, it verifies that the file on disk still matches what was applied. Edit the file and the checksums disagree:

```console
$ npx prisma migrate deploy

Error: The migration `20260630131500_add_user_bio` was modified after it was applied.
```

*What just happened:* the on-disk file no longer matches the recorded checksum, so deploy halts. This is a feature, not an annoyance - it guarantees that what ran on production is exactly what's in your repo. If you need to change something, you add a *new* migration that alters it. History is append-only, like a ledger.

## When a migration fails halfway

In production, a migration can fail partway - a unique constraint hits existing duplicate data, a statement times out. Prisma marks that migration as failed in `_prisma_migrations`, and subsequent `migrate deploy` runs refuse to continue until you resolve it:

```console
$ npx prisma migrate resolve --rolled-back 20260630131500_add_user_bio
```

*What just happened:* you told Prisma "I manually reverted that failed migration's effects; mark it rolled back so it can be retried." Use `--applied` instead if you finished the migration's work by hand and want Prisma to consider it done. Either way, *you* fix the database state; `resolve` only updates Prisma's bookkeeping to match the reality you've restored.

> Before risky migrations on a live database, take a backup. Prisma does not roll back automatically across statements on every database, so a partial failure can leave you in a state only a human (or a backup) can sort out. Test the migration against a copy of production data first when the change touches a large or constrained table.

## A team-safe checklist

```text
- Commit schema.prisma AND the new migration folder in the same commit.
- Never run `migrate dev` against staging or production.
- Never edit a migration that has already been applied anywhere; add a new one.
- Run `migrate deploy` as a release step before new code serves traffic.
- Back up production before migrations that touch large or constrained tables.
- Rebased a branch and now have two migrations same-day? Verify their order
  by timestamp and that both still apply cleanly into a fresh database.
```

*What just happened:* every item traces back to the same idea from phase 1 - schema, history, and database must keep agreeing. Drift detection and checksums are the guardrails; this checklist is how you avoid tripping them.

## In the wild

On teams, the painful drift case is two developers each running `migrate dev` the same day on separate branches. Both migrations apply fine alone, but when both land on `main`, their timestamp order may differ from the order they were authored in. Before merging, it's worth confirming the combined set applies cleanly into a fresh database - that's exactly what the shadow database does for you locally, and what a CI step running `migrate deploy` against an empty database confirms for the team. For the deeper theory of ordering and reversibility, see [/guides/database-migrations](/guides/database-migrations).
