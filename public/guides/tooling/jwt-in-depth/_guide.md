# JWT, In Depth

You copied a JWT out of a request header, pasted it somewhere, and got back a wall of `eyJ...` that looked encrypted and important. Then someone said "don't put secrets in it" and you got confused, because if it's encrypted, why not? This guide clears that up. A JWT is not encrypted. It's a signed, readable note. Once you see what each of its three parts actually does, the security rules stop being magic words and start being obvious.

## How to read this

Read phase 1 first, slowly. The whole point of a JWT lives in the relationship between the three parts and the one signature, and if that mental model is solid, everything else is detail. Phase 2 is the everyday flow: issuing, sending, and verifying tokens, plus the claims that do the real work. Phase 3 is the part that keeps people employed in incident response: the attacks, the revocation problem, and the rules you break exactly once before you learn them.

2. [Phase 2: Issuing, Sending, and Verifying](02-issuing-sending-verifying.md) - how you really use tokens day to day
3. [Phase 3: Where It Breaks](03-where-it-breaks.md) - the attacks, the revocation problem, and production reality
