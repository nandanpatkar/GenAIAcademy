# What Podman Actually Is

Here is the thing nobody tells you about Docker until you have to explain it to a security team: when you run `docker run`, your command barely does anything. It hands a request to a long-running background service - the Docker daemon, `dockerd` - and that service, running as root, does the actual work of pulling images and starting containers. Your terminal is a remote control. The daemon is the machine.

Podman's whole pitch is: get rid of the machine. There is no daemon. When you run `podman run`, *that process* pulls the image and starts the container. When the container runs, it is a child of your shell, not a child of a root service you never see. That one architectural choice ripples into everything else, so it is worth slowing down on.

## The daemon, and why it bothers people

Docker's architecture looks like this:

```text
you ──> docker (CLI) ──> dockerd (root daemon) ──> containerd ──> your container
        unprivileged     runs as root             also root      runs as root by default
```

*What just happened:* every container you start is ultimately launched by a privileged, always-on service. If `dockerd` crashes, every container it manages can go with it. If someone compromises the daemon's socket, they effectively have root on the host, because the daemon *is* root and will do what it is told.

Podman's architecture is flatter:

```text
you ──> podman ──> conmon ──> your container
        your user            your user (rootless)
```

*What just happened:* there is no central privileged broker. `podman` does the setup itself and then hands the running container to a tiny monitor process called `conmon` (container monitor), which babysits it so the container keeps running after your `podman` command exits. No root daemon sits in the middle.

> The shorthand you will hear is "daemonless." It does not mean nothing runs in the background - `conmon` does, one per container. It means there is no single long-lived root service that owns every container on the box.

## Rootless: the part that actually matters

"Daemonless" is the architecture. "Rootless" is the consequence people care about.

Because Podman runs as *you*, it can start containers without root at all. It does this with a Linux kernel feature called **user namespaces**: inside the container, a process can think it is UID 0 (root), while outside, on the host, it is mapped to your unprivileged user. The container sees root; the host sees you.

```console
$ id -u
1000

$ podman run --rm alpine id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),...

$ podman run --rm alpine sleep 600 &
$ ps -o user,pid,cmd -C sleep
USER       PID CMD
chris    48213 sleep 600
```

*What just happened:* inside the container the process is `root` (uid 0). On the host, the very same process belongs to `chris`, an ordinary user. A container breakout would land an attacker as `chris`, not as host root. That is the security win in one sentence: a compromised container does not hand over the whole machine.

This mapping is driven by two files, `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid`, which grant your user a range of "subordinate" UIDs to hand out inside containers. If Podman ever complains about user namespaces on a fresh box, those files (or the `newuidmap`/`newgidmap` helpers) are almost always the missing piece.

## "Drop-in for Docker" - true, with footnotes

Podman implements the same command-line interface as Docker on purpose. The verbs, flags, and image format (OCI - the Open Container Initiative standard, which Docker also produces) are shared. So this works:

```console
$ alias docker=podman
$ docker run --rm -p 8080:80 docker.io/library/nginx
```

*What just happened:* you aliased `docker` to `podman` and a standard `docker run` line worked unchanged. Most scripts, most tutorials, most muscle memory carry straight over. Note the full image name `docker.io/library/nginx` - Podman does not assume Docker Hub the way Docker does, a difference phase 2 returns to.

The footnotes are real, though, and they all trace back to the missing daemon:

- There is no `docker.sock` by default, so tools that talk to the Docker API need Podman's compatibility socket switched on (phase 3).
- Containers do not auto-restart on reboot via a daemon, because there is no daemon to do it - you use systemd instead (phase 3).
- Rootless networking and low ports behave differently, because you are not root (phase 2 and 3).

None of these are dealbreakers. They are the bill that comes due for not running a privileged daemon, and for many teams it is a bill worth paying.

## For builders

If you are coming from [/guides/docker-without-the-magic](/guides/docker-without-the-magic), the mental shift is small but load-bearing: stop thinking of "the container engine" as a service you talk to, and start thinking of it as a command you run. Everything that used to be the daemon's job - restarts, the API socket, owning the container lifecycle - becomes either your job or systemd's job. That reframing is most of what makes Podman click.
