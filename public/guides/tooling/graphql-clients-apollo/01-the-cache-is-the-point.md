# The cache is the point

Here's the trap most people fall into. They learn GraphQL, see that it returns JSON over HTTP, and conclude that a GraphQL client is "fetch, but for GraphQL." So they reach for `fetch`, POST a query string, and get JSON back. That works for one screen. Then the app grows, and the parts that have nothing to do with GraphQL start hurting: the same user is loaded by three components, a profile edit doesn't update the header, and every list keeps a stale copy of rows you already have.

Apollo Client exists to solve that second set of problems. The query syntax is the small part. The big part is a **normalized cache** that sits between your components and the network, and the whole reason to pull in a client library instead of `fetch` is that cache.

## What GraphQL gives the client first

Before the cache, one thing about GraphQL itself shapes everything that follows: the client asks for exactly the fields it wants. With REST, the endpoint decides the shape of the response. With GraphQL, your component does.

```graphql
query GetUser {
  user(id: "42") {
    id
    name
    avatarUrl
  }
}
```

*What just happened:* you asked for three fields and you'll get exactly those three back - no `email`, no `createdAt`, no nested objects you didn't request. Under REST this is the over-fetching problem (the endpoint sends a fat object) and the under-fetching problem (you need a second call for related data). GraphQL collapses both: one request, the precise shape, related data nested in.

If that contrast is new to you, the deep version lives in [GraphQL Explained](/guides/graphql-explained) and [REST APIs Explained](/guides/rest-apis-explained). Here we take it as given and ask the next question: where does that response go once it arrives?

## The normalized cache, plainly

A naive client would store responses by query. "The result of `GetUser` is *this blob*." That's what a `fetch`-based setup does, and it's why the same user ends up duplicated - every query that mentions user 42 keeps its own copy, and they drift apart.

Apollo does something different. It **flattens** every response into a flat table of objects, keyed by type and id. User 42 is stored once, under a key like `User:42`, no matter how many queries returned it.

```text
ROOT_QUERY
  user({"id":"42"})  ──►  ref: User:42

User:42
  id:        "42"
  name:      "Ada"
  avatarUrl: "https://.../ada.png"
```

*What just happened:* the cache split the response into two pieces. `ROOT_QUERY` remembers that the `user(id: 42)` query points at the object `User:42`, and `User:42` holds the actual fields. The query result is a *reference*, not a copy. That single indirection is the whole trick.

Why does that matter? Because the next time *any* query returns user 42 - a different screen, a different query name, a list that happens to include them - Apollo writes the fields back into the same `User:42` entry. Every component reading that user is looking at one source of truth.

```text
ROOT_QUERY
  user({"id":"42"})       ──►  ref: User:42
  teamMembers             ──►  [ ref: User:42, ref: User:51, ... ]

User:42   (one entry, two readers)
  name: "Ada"   ◄── update this once, both views re-render
```

*What just happened:* a list query and a single-user query both resolved to the same `User:42` object. Update that name once and Apollo re-renders every component subscribed to it. No event bus, no manual prop-drilling, no "refresh the header after save." This is the payoff you cannot get from `fetch` without rebuilding a chunk of Apollo by hand.

> The cache keys off `__typename` plus `id` (or `_id`) by default. If your objects don't carry a stable id, normalization silently can't happen and you lose most of this benefit. We come back to that landmine in Phase 3.

## How the pieces fit

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  C[Component] -->|useQuery| A[Apollo Client]
  A -->|cache hit| K[(Normalized cache)]
  A -->|cache miss| N[GraphQL server]
  N --> K
  K --> C
```

*What just happened:* a component asks for data through a hook. Apollo checks the normalized cache first. On a hit, it returns instantly with no network call. On a miss, it goes to the server, writes the result into the cache, and serves it. The component never talks to the network directly - it talks to the cache, and the cache talks to the network.

This is the mental flip from REST. In a REST app you think in *requests*: "call `GET /users/42`, hold the result in component state." In Apollo you think in *data that already lives somewhere*: "I need user 42; give me whatever the cache knows, fetch only if it's missing." The request becomes an implementation detail of the cache.

## What you give up

None of this is free, and pretending otherwise is how people get burned in Phase 3. The normalized cache is a second copy of your server's data living in the browser, and like any cache it can be wrong. After a mutation, after a delete, after another user changes something - the cache can hold data the server no longer agrees with. Most of the real work with Apollo is keeping that cache honest, which is exactly what Phase 2 is about.

**For builders:** the practical line is this. If your app shows the same entities across many screens and edits them in place, the normalized cache earns its weight fast. If you're building a few read-only pages that never share data, `fetch` plus a query string is genuinely enough, and reaching for Apollo is the kind of complexity you'll resent later.
