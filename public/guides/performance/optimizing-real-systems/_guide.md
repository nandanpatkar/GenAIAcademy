# Optimizing Real Systems

You've measured something. Maybe you profiled a slow endpoint, or you finally wired up tracing and now you can see where requests spend their time. Good. But there's a gap nobody talks about between *having data* and *making the system faster* - and it's a gap people fall into for weeks. They tweak, they tune, they rewrite a clever loop, and the graph that matters doesn't move. Or it moves, and a week later nobody can say why, or whether it was worth it.

This guide is the capstone. It assumes you can already take a measurement (if you can't yet, start with [Profiling 101](/guides/profiling-101) and [Observability: Logs, Metrics, Traces](/guides/observability-logs-metrics-traces)) and it teaches the harder thing: how to turn measurement into durable speed. The disciplined loop that keeps you honest. Where the time actually goes in real-world systems, ranked, so you look in the right place first. And how to make a system faster in production - under real traffic, watching the right numbers - without trading away the correctness and readability you'll regret losing.

The thread running through all of it: **the fastest code is the work you never do.** Most real wins come not from making the work faster but from doing less of it.

## How to read this

- **Already deep in an optimization that isn't paying off?** Jump to [Phase 1: The Optimization Loop](01-the-optimization-loop.md) - you're probably missing a baseline or a target, and that's the whole problem.
- **Don't know where to look first?** [Phase 2: Where the Time Actually Goes](02-where-the-time-goes.md) ranks the usual suspects so you start at the top, not the bottom.
- **Want it to finally make sense?** Read in order - each phase builds on the last.

## The phases

1. **[The Optimization Loop](01-the-optimization-loop.md)** - measure, find the bottleneck, form one hypothesis, change *one* thing, re-measure, repeat - against a target you set in advance, and stop when you hit it.
2. **[Where the Time Actually Goes](02-where-the-time-goes.md)** - the real-world bottlenecks ranked: the database, the network, I/O and serialization, then CPU and algorithms - and the biggest lever of all, doing less work.
3. **[Optimizing Safely in Production](03-optimizing-safely-in-production.md)** - verify with real traffic and observability, watch percentiles not averages, and steer clear of the classic traps: micro-optimizing a cold path, optimizing the wrong layer, and trading correctness for speed you didn't need.

> Deliberately out of scope: the *mechanics* of taking a measurement. This guide is about what to do with the measurement once you have it. For flame graphs, sampling profilers, and reading a trace, see [Profiling 101](/guides/profiling-101) and [Observability: Logs, Metrics, Traces](/guides/observability-logs-metrics-traces).
