# CORS, Explained (and Why It Keeps Blocking You)

You wrote some perfectly reasonable code. Your frontend on `localhost:5173` calls your API on
`localhost:3000`, and the browser slams the door: *"blocked by CORS policy."* You can see the response
sitting right there in the Network tab - the API answered fine - but your JavaScript can't touch it. It
feels like the browser is sabotaging you for no reason.

It isn't. CORS is a safety rule the browser enforces *on behalf of the person using it*, and once you see
what it's actually protecting against, the error stops being mysterious and the fix becomes obvious.

## How to read this

- **Blocked right now and just need the fix?** Jump to [Phase 3: Fixing It Properly](03-fixing-it-properly.md)
  and use the cheat-card at the top - but read the one ⚠️ about `*` before you ship it.
- **Want it to finally make sense?** Read in order. Each phase builds on the last: the *why* (Phase 1), the
  *what you're seeing* (Phase 2), then the *fix* (Phase 3).

## The phases

1. **[Why the Browser Blocks You](01-why-the-browser-blocks-you.md)** - the same-origin policy, and the
   one idea that makes all of CORS click: the browser enforces, the server permits.
2. **[Reading the Error & the Headers](02-reading-the-error-and-the-headers.md)** - decode the console
   message, the `Origin` request header, the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header, and the
   preflight `OPTIONS` request.
3. **[Fixing It Properly](03-fixing-it-properly.md)** - set the right headers on the *server*, why
   credentials and wildcards don't mix, and a symptom-to-fix cheat-card.

> Deeper material - fine-grained per-route policies, caching preflights with `Access-Control-Max-Age`,
> and CORS in front of CDNs and gateways - is deferred to a follow-up guide. This one gets you unblocked,
> safely.
