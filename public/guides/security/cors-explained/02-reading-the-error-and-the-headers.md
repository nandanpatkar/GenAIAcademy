# Reading the Error & the Headers

The CORS error in the console looks like a wall of jargon, but it's actually telling you exactly what's
wrong - once you know which words to read. This phase decodes the message, shows the two headers the whole
dance comes down to, and meets the surprise extra request (the *preflight*) that confuses people the first
time they spot it in the Network tab.

## Decoding the classic error

Here's the message you came for, straight from a browser console:

```text
Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:3000/api/users' from origin
'http://localhost:5173' has been blocked by CORS policy: No
'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

Read it slowly, phrase by phrase - it's a complete diagnosis:

```text
   Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:3000/api/users'   ← WHAT you tried to read
   from origin 'http://localhost:5173'                    ← WHERE your page is running
   has been blocked by CORS policy:                       ← the browser enforced the rule
   No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present     ← WHY: the server sent no
       on the requested resource.                            permission slip
```

*What this is telling you:* your page on `localhost:5173` asked `localhost:3000` for data, the browser
checked the response for a permission header, found none, and refused to hand you the body. The fix lives
entirely on the server at `localhost:3000` - it needs to send that header. (Phase 3.)

⚠️ **Don't get sent on a wild goose chase by the word "fetch."** The error is not about your `fetch()`
code being wrong. Your request was fine. The browser blocked the *reading of the response*. No amount of
editing the frontend `fetch` call will fix a missing server header.

You'll see a few variants of this message; they all point at the same server-side cause:

| What the console says | What it actually means |
|---|---|
| `No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present` | The server sent no CORS permission at all |
| `The 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header has a value '...' that is not equal to the supplied origin` | The server allowed a *different* origin than yours |
| `Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check` | The preflight `OPTIONS` request was rejected (see below) |
| `...does not have HTTP ok status` | The server answered the preflight `OPTIONS` with an error instead of a success |

## The two headers it all comes down to

CORS, in its simplest form, is a short conversation between exactly two headers.

**The request header - `Origin`.** The browser adds this *automatically* to cross-origin requests. You
don't set it; you can't fake it from JavaScript. It tells the server where the calling page lives.

**The response header - `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`.** The server sends this back to name which origin
is allowed to read the response. The browser compares it against the `Origin` it sent.

Here is a healthy exchange, annotated:

```http
GET /api/users HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3000
Origin: http://localhost:5173          ← browser added this: "I'm calling from here"
```
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:5173   ← server: "that origin may read this"

[{"id":1,"name":"Ada"}]
```
*What just happened:* the browser announced its origin, the server echoed back the *same* origin in
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, the browser saw a match, and your JavaScript got the JSON. When the server
*omits* that response header - or returns a different origin - the body is the same, but the browser
refuses to let you read it, and you get the console error above.

💡 **Key point:** the browser doesn't trust *intent*, it checks a *header*. The server has to literally
say the magic words in the response. Silence means "no."

## The plot twist: the preflight `OPTIONS` request

The first time you open the Network tab and see an `OPTIONS` request you never wrote, sitting right before
your actual request, it's genuinely baffling. Here's what's going on.

📝 **Preflight request.** For requests that could *change data* or carry unusual headers, the browser
sends a small `OPTIONS` request *first* - a "may I?" - and only sends the real request if the server says
yes. This is the **preflight**.

**Why it exists.** Some requests are too risky to fire blindly. A `DELETE`, or a `POST` with a JSON
content type, or any request with a custom header like `Authorization` could cause real damage if the
server wasn't expecting cross-origin callers. So the browser checks *permission in advance* instead of
sending the dangerous request and apologizing afterward.

**Simple vs. non-simple - what triggers a preflight.** Not every request gets one. A "simple" request
skips the preflight; anything else triggers it.

```text
   SIMPLE (no preflight)              NON-SIMPLE (preflight fires first)
   ─────────────────────              ─────────────────────────────────
   • GET or HEAD or POST          vs. • PUT, DELETE, PATCH
   • only basic headers               • custom headers (e.g. Authorization,
   • POST body is a form or             X-API-Key)
     plain text                        • POST with Content-Type:
                                         application/json
                                       • requests sending credentials in
                                         some cases
```

Most real API calls - a JSON `POST`, anything with an auth token - are *non-simple*, which is why you see
preflights so often. Here's a preflight conversation in full:

```http
OPTIONS /api/users HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3000
Origin: http://localhost:5173
Access-Control-Request-Method: POST              ← "I want to do a POST"
Access-Control-Request-Headers: content-type     ← "…and send this header"
```
```http
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:5173   ← "that origin is okay"
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, DELETE      ← "…these methods are okay"
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: content-type           ← "…that header is okay"
```
*What just happened:* before sending your real `POST`, the browser asked the server "I'm from
`localhost:5173`, I want to `POST` with a `content-type` header - allowed?" The server answered "yes, that
origin, those methods, that header." The browser saw approval and *then* sent the actual `POST`. If the
server had not approved the method or header, the browser would stop here - and you'd see *"Response to
preflight request doesn't pass access control check."*

The two-step "may I? / yes / now the real one" shape is the whole idea of a preflight:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Browser
  participant Server
  Browser->>Server: OPTIONS (preflight): may I POST with content-type?
  Server-->>Browser: 204 + Allow-Origin / Allow-Methods / Allow-Headers
  Browser->>Server: the real POST /api/users
  Server-->>Browser: 200 + the data
```

⚠️ **The preflight is a separate request with its own rules.** Your real request can fail at the
preflight stage and never even run. If the error mentions "preflight," the problem is the `OPTIONS`
response - the server isn't allowing your method or your headers, not (yet) the data request itself.

**Why this saves you later.** When you can read the error and know the two headers, debugging becomes
mechanical: open the Network tab, find the failing request (or its `OPTIONS` preflight), look at the
`Origin` it sent, and check whether the response's `Access-Control-Allow-*` headers cover it. The mismatch
is always right there.

## Recap

1. The console error names *where you called from*, *what you tried to read*, and *which header was
   missing* - read it phrase by phrase.
2. "Blocked by CORS" is a **server header problem**, not a bug in your `fetch`.
3. The browser auto-sends **`Origin`**; the server must answer with a matching
   **`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`**.
4. **Non-simple** requests (PUT/DELETE/PATCH, JSON POST, custom headers) trigger a **preflight `OPTIONS`**
   request that must be approved before the real request runs.
5. An error mentioning "preflight" means the `OPTIONS` response didn't allow your method or headers.

Change the method, the server's header, and credentials to see exactly when the browser allows or blocks the response:
