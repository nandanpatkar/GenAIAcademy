# Defense in Depth & Least Privilege

You know what you're protecting, and where the danger crosses into your system. The temptation now is to find the one perfect lock and call it done. This phase is about why that instinct is wrong - and the three principles experienced people reach for instead. They're not techniques; they're *attitudes* that shape every technique you'll ever learn.

## Defense in depth: no single wall is enough

**The principle.** Assume any one defense will eventually fail, and put another one behind it. Security isn't a wall; it's layers, so that getting past one still leaves an attacker outside the next.

**Why one wall fails.** Every lock has a flaw eventually - a bug, a misconfiguration, a leaked password, a clever input nobody predicted. If your whole defense is one wall, the day it cracks an attacker has *everything*. You're betting the entire system on never making a single mistake, and nobody wins that bet forever.

  attacker([attacker]) --> L1[network locked down]
  L1 --> L2[strong login + 2FA]
  L2 --> L3[least-privilege access]
  L3 --> L4[data encrypted at rest]
  L4 --> L5[logging + alerts]
```

*What just happened:* No single failure is fatal here. An attacker who gets past the login still hits limited access; if they get further, the data they reach is encrypted; and the whole time, logging is quietly raising a flag. Each layer buys time and shrinks what a breach costs.

💡 **Key point.** Defense in depth means you're allowed to be imperfect on any one layer, because you didn't bet everything on it. Not a lower bar - how real systems survive real mistakes.

## Least privilege: minimum access, always

**The principle.** Give every person, every component, every piece of code *the least access it needs to do its job* - and nothing more.

**What it actually is.** When part of your system needs to read the orders table, it gets read access to the orders table. Not write access. Not access to the users table. Not admin. Just the one thing, scoped as tightly as you can make it.

**Why this matters so much.** Combine it with defense in depth's core truth - *something will eventually get compromised* - and least privilege decides how bad that day is. A compromised piece that could only read one table costs you one table; one with admin "to keep things simple" costs you everything.

```text
   TOO MUCH PRIVILEGE:                  LEAST PRIVILEGE:

   report-generator                     report-generator
     └─ admin on entire database          └─ read-only on the 'sales' table

   if it's compromised →                if it's compromised →
     attacker gets the WHOLE database     attacker gets read-only on one table
```

*What just happened:* Same compromise, wildly different outcome. Least privilege doesn't stop the break-in - it makes the break-in *cheap*. The component never needed more than read-on-one-table, so handing it more was pure downside.

⚠️ **Gotcha.** Broad access creeps in because it's *convenient* - it makes things "just work" during development and you mean to tighten it later. "Later" rarely comes, and over-broad permissions are one of the most common findings in any real audit. Scope it tight from the start; widen only when something actually breaks for lack of access.

## Assume breach: limit the blast radius

**The principle.** Don't only plan for *keeping attackers out*. Plan for *when one gets in* - because eventually one will - and design so the damage is contained.

📝 **Terminology.** *Blast radius* = how much damage a single compromise can do. The goal of "assume breach" is to keep the blast radius small: one account, one server, one table - not the whole company.

This ties the first two together: defense in depth assumes a layer will fail, least privilege assumes a component will be turned against you, and "assume breach" makes that the *starting point* of your design rather than a sad surprise. You stop asking only "how do I keep them out?" and start also asking "when they're in, how do I limit what they reach, and how do I find out fast?"

In practice that means: separate systems so one falling doesn't topple the rest, keep logs so you can *see* a breach happening, and rehearse what you'd actually do. You don't need to build all that today - you need to stop designing as if the wall will never be breached.

## Two truths people learn the hard way

### Security by obscurity isn't security

⚠️ **Gotcha.** Hiding how something works is *not* the same as protecting it. A secret URL anyone can guess or stumble onto, a "hidden" admin page with no real login, a homemade scheme kept private - these feel safe right up until someone finds them, and then offer no protection at all.

The honest version: *obscurity can be a thin extra layer, but never the layer you rely on.* A real lock works even when the attacker knows exactly how it works - that's the whole point of a good lock. If your security depends on the attacker not knowing your secret *method*, you've built on sand. (This is why serious cryptography is published openly and still holds: the strength is in the key, not in hiding the design.)

### Humans are the soft target

🪖 **War story.** You can build perfect layers, scope every privilege, and assume breach beautifully - and an attacker can skip all of it by emailing an employee a convincing "reset your password here" link. That's **phishing**: tricking a *person* into handing over access. It works because it doesn't attack your code at all; it attacks the human in front of it.

📝 **Terminology.** *Phishing* = a fake message (email, text, call) designed to trick someone into revealing a password, clicking a malicious link, or approving something they shouldn't. It targets people, not systems.

Security is never *only* a technical problem. The most carefully secured system still has people with keys, and people can be fooled, rushed, or flattered into using those keys wrong. Defense in depth applies here too: assume someone *will* eventually click the bad link, and make sure that mistake doesn't hand over everything - short-lived sessions, a second factor on logins, least privilege so a stolen account can't reach the whole kingdom.

## Recap

1. **Defense in depth** - assume any one defense fails; stack layers so no single failure is fatal.
2. **Least privilege** - give every person and component the minimum access it needs; this is what makes a breach *cheap* instead of catastrophic.
3. **Assume breach** - design for *when* someone gets in, not just *if*; keep the blast radius small and make breaches visible.
4. **Obscurity isn't security** - hiding how something works is at best a thin extra layer, never the one you rely on.
5. **Humans are the soft target** - phishing skips your code entirely, so your layers have to survive a person making one honest mistake.

## Where to go next

You now have the *map* - the foundation the whole field stands on. The specific holes, and exactly how to close them, come next:

- **[The OWASP Top 10](/guides/owasp-top-10)** - the most common real-world vulnerabilities, named and explained. This is the canonical list of doors attackers actually use.
- **[Auth vs. Authz](/guides/auth-vs-authz)** - the difference between proving *who you are* (authentication) and what you're *allowed to do* (authorization) - two of the most important, most-confused trust-boundary checks there are.

Read those with the mindset you just built, and they'll read like a checklist of abuse cases - exactly what they are.
