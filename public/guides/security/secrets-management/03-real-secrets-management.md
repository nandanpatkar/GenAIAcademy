# Real Secrets Management

A `.env` file on your laptop is fine for one developer. But picture a team of twelve, three environments, and forty services that each need a key. Who has the production database password? How do you change it everywhere when someone leaves? How do you know who *read* it last week? `.env` files copied around in chat answer none of that - and on a real system, those questions are the whole job. The relief here is structural: instead of secrets scattered across laptops, they live in one guarded place that knows who touched what.

But first, because you might be reading this *while a key is loose*, the cheat-card.

## The leaked-secret cheat-card

> **A secret got out. Stay calm and go in this order: revoke, rotate, audit. Speed beats perfection - kill the key first, investigate after.**

| Step | What you do | Why it's in this order |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Revoke** | Go to the service and **disable/delete the leaked key immediately.** | A dead key can't be abused while you figure out the rest - the lock change, done first. |
| **2. Rotate** | Issue a **new** key, put it in your secrets store, and redeploy so the app uses it. | Restores service on a clean credential; the old value is now worthless no matter who has it. |
| **3. Audit** | Check the service's **logs / access history** for use you didn't make, and find *how* it leaked so it can't recur. | Tells you whether damage was done, and closes the hole (a bad `.gitignore`, a logged header, a shared screenshot). |

Three more notes for the moment of panic: **assume it was seen** (bots are fast, per Phase 1); **don't try to scrub Git history first** (revoking the key makes the leaked copy harmless instantly, which history-rewriting never can - see [Git Disaster Recovery](/guides/git-disaster-recovery)); and **tell your team** so nobody is surprised by the rotation or the new charges.

## A secrets manager: one guarded place

**What it actually is.** A **secrets manager** (or **vault**) is a dedicated service whose entire job is to hold secrets safely and hand them out carefully. Instead of living in files on developer laptops, secrets live in one central system that does four things a flat file can't:

```mermaid

  app["app asks at startup<br/>'give me DB_PASSWORD'"] --> sm
  human["human asks via CLI/console<br/>(request is logged)"] --> sm
  sm["Secrets Manager<br/>• ENCRYPTED at rest<br/>• ACCESS-CONTROLLED - who can read which secret<br/>• AUDITED - every read logged (who, when)<br/>• ROTATABLE - change a secret in ONE place"]
```

📝 **Terminology.** The category includes self-hosted **HashiCorp Vault** and managed cloud offerings - **AWS Secrets Manager**, **Google Secret Manager**, **Azure Key Vault**. They differ in features and where they run, but the core promise is the same: encrypted central storage, fine-grained access control, an audit trail, and a single place to rotate.

**Why this beats `.env` for teams.** Every property maps to a question `.env` couldn't answer. *Who has the prod password?* → access control says exactly who. *Did anyone use it suspiciously?* → the audit log shows every read. *How do I change it everywhere?* → rotate it once and every app picks up the new value. The secret stops being a thing you copy and starts being a thing you *request*.

## Inject at runtime - don't bake secrets into the image

**What it actually is.** **Runtime injection** means your application receives its secrets *when it starts up*, fetched fresh from the secrets manager (or set as environment variables by the platform) rather than written into the build.

**Why people get this wrong.** A tempting shortcut, especially with containers, is to copy the `.env` file or hardcode a key into the **Docker image** during the build so "it's all in one place." Don't. A built image is an artifact that gets pushed to a registry, pulled to many machines, and often kept around in old versions - a secret baked into it is copied into every layer, every pull, every cached version. The Phase 1 problem all over again, just in a different file format.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph bad["BAD"]
    b1[build time] --> b2["image: app code + SECRET baked in"] --> b3["registry, every host, old versions<br/>(secret copied everywhere)"]
  end
  subgraph good["GOOD"]
    g1[build time] --> g2["image: app code only, no secrets"]
    g3[start time] --> g4["app fetches SECRET from manager / platform env<br/>holds it in memory"]
  end
```

The image stays clean and shareable; the secret only ever lives in memory on the running machine, supplied at the last moment by something access-controlled and audited.

## Least privilege: a key should open one door

⚠️ **Gotcha - over-powered keys turn a small leak into a big one.** **Least privilege** means each key is granted *only* the permissions it actually needs, nothing more. The reporting service that only ever reads should get a **read-only** key, not an admin key that can also delete. A webhook handler that only writes to one table shouldn't hold credentials for the whole database.

The reason is blast radius. Possession is permission (Phase 1), so the damage a leaked key can do is exactly the set of permissions you gave it. A leaked read-only analytics key is an annoyance; a leaked god-mode admin key is a catastrophe. Scoping every key down means that *when* one leaks - and over enough time, one will - the worst case is small. You're not preventing the leak with least privilege; you're capping what it can cost.

## Rotation: assume every secret will eventually leak

Here's the mindset shift that separates anxious teams from calm ones. Don't treat a leak as a rare failure to be horrified by - treat it as **inevitable over a long enough timeline**, and build so that handling it is routine.

**What it actually is.** **Rotation** is replacing a secret with a fresh one on a regular cadence (and immediately on any suspected leak). If a key is changed every ninety days regardless, any copy an attacker quietly grabbed has a limited shelf life, and the *process* of changing it becomes routine rather than terrifying.

💡 **Key point.** A team that has never rotated a secret will rotate slowly and nervously the day they're forced to - exactly when they can least afford to fumble. A team that rotates on a schedule treats an emergency rotation as "the Tuesday thing, done early." Many secrets managers can even rotate certain credentials automatically. Make rotation routine, and the cheat-card at the top of this phase becomes a procedure you've run a dozen times, not a crisis you've never rehearsed.

**Why this saves you later.** Put the pieces together and a leak stops being a disaster. The key was **least-privileged**, so it couldn't do much. It was in a **secrets manager**, so you revoke and rotate it in one place and the **audit log** tells you if it was used. It was **injected at runtime**, so it isn't frozen into a dozen images you'd have to rebuild. And because you **rotate routinely**, the response is a familiar drill.

## Recap

1. **Leaked-secret response is revoke → rotate → audit**, in that order - kill the key first, investigate after.
2. A **secrets manager** (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Google Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault) stores secrets centrally - **encrypted, access-controlled, and audited** - and lets you rotate in one place.
3. **Inject secrets at runtime**, fetched at startup; never bake them into a built image, where they get copied everywhere.
4. ⚠️ Apply **least privilege** to every key so a leak's blast radius stays small.
5. **Rotate routinely.** Assume any secret will eventually leak; regular rotation limits an old key's life and turns emergency rotation into a rehearsed, boring move.

## That's the whole skill

Look back at where you started: a hardcoded key and a sinking feeling. Now you can name what a secret is, keep keys out of your code and out of Git, know that a committed secret means *rotate, not delete*, and understand how teams store, scope, inject, and rotate secrets so a leak is contained and recoverable. Treat every secret like a house key, and you'll sleep fine.
