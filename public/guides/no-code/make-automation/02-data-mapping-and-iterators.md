# Data Mapping, Arrays & Iterators

Building a scenario is mostly one activity: telling each module which data to use. That's mapping. Master mapping and the lists-of-things problem, and there's almost nothing in Make you can't build.

## Mapping a single field

When you open a module - say "Create a Trello card" - its fields are blank. Click into a field and Make drops down a panel showing every field from every earlier module, grouped by module. You click `email` from the trigger, and a colored token appears in the field. That token is a reference: "put the email value from step 1 here, at run time."

You can mix tokens with literal text. A subject line might read:

```text
New signup: {{name}} ({{email}})
```

Each `{{...}}` is a mapped token; the rest is typed. At run time Make substitutes the real values. If `name` is empty for a given bundle, the token resolves to nothing - Make doesn't error, it leaves a gap. That silent emptiness is a frequent source of "why is my message blank" confusion, so check your test runs.

## Functions: reshaping values inline

Often the raw value isn't in the shape the next app wants. The mapping panel has a second tab full of **functions** - small transformations you wrap around a token.

A few you'll reach for constantly:

```text
upper(name)                  → "ADA LOVELACE"
formatDate(signed_up; "MMMM D, YYYY")  → "June 30, 2026"
trim(notes)                  → strips leading/trailing spaces
if(amount > 1000; "big"; "small")      → conditional value
substring(phone; 0; 3)       → first three characters
```

Functions nest, so you can `upper(trim(name))`. The big three categories are **text** (case, trim, split, replace), **date/time** (parse and format - and dates are where most beginners get stuck, because a string from one app rarely matches what the next app expects), and **math/logic** (`if`, comparisons, rounding). You don't memorize these; you open the functions tab and skim.

## Routers: sending bundles down different paths

A **router** is a module that splits the flow into branches. Each branch can have a **filter** - a condition on the line. The bundle takes every branch whose filter passes.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  T[New order] --> R{Router}
  R -->|amount > 1000| S[Notify sales]
  R -->|amount <= 1000| L[Just log it]
```

Filters are how you say "only continue if." You set them by clicking the wrench on the line between two modules. A filter that fails stops that bundle on that path - quietly, not as an error. Routers are Make's answer to "if this, do that; otherwise do this other thing," and they're far cleaner than the bolt-on branching in checklist tools.

## The list problem: arrays

Real data is full of lists. An invoice has many line items. An API returns many search results. A single bundle field can itself hold an **array** - a list of items, each with its own fields.

Here's the catch: a normal module processes one item. If you map an array directly into "Create a row," you'll get unpredictable behavior, because the module expected one value and got a list. Make gives you two tools for the gap between "one thing" and "many things," and knowing which to use is the core skill of this phase.

### Iterator: split one bundle into many

An **Iterator** takes an array and breaks it into separate bundles - one per item. Feed it an array of three line items, and every module *after* the iterator runs three times, once per item.

```text
Before iterator:  1 bundle  { items: [A, B, C] }
After iterator:   3 bundles  {A}  {B}  {C}
```

Use an iterator when you have a list and want to *do something with each item* - create a row per line item, send a message per recipient.

### Array Aggregator: collapse many bundles into one

The **Array Aggregator** is the mirror image. It takes many bundles and merges them back into a single bundle holding one array.

```text
Before aggregator:  3 bundles  {A}  {B}  {C}
After aggregator:   1 bundle  { collected: [A, B, C] }
```

Use an aggregator when downstream you want *one* of something built from many - one summary email listing all items, one API call with all records attached. There's also a **Text Aggregator** for stitching many bundles into one block of text (great for "build a list and put it in one message").

The classic pattern is the pair: **iterator → process each → aggregator**. Split a list apart, do work on each piece, then gather the results back into one. When a scenario "runs too many times" or "only does the last item," the fix is almost always a missing or misplaced iterator/aggregator.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A[Get invoice] --> B[Iterator: line items]
  B --> C[Lookup product]
  C --> D[Array aggregator]
  D --> E[One summary record]
```

## A worked picture

Say a webhook delivers an order with three line items, and you want one Slack message summarizing them, but only for orders over $50.

1. Webhook receives the order → verify: bundle shows the `items` array.
2. Filter on the line: `total > 50` → verify: small orders stop here.
3. Iterator over `items` → verify: downstream runs once per item.
4. (Optional lookup per item) → verify: each item gets enriched.
5. Text Aggregator joins items into one block → verify: one bundle out.
6. Slack module sends the joined text → verify: one message, all items listed.

Notice the rhythm: split, work, gather. Once that pattern is in your hands, the rest of Make is picking the right module and mapping the right field. The next phase covers what happens when a step fails mid-run - and the operations cost that all this iterating quietly racks up.
