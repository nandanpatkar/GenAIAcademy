# What Enterprise Low-Code Is

Picture a developer building an internal expense-approval app the traditional way. They write the database schema by hand, the backend API, the front-end screens, the validation, the login system, the audit logging, and then they wire it all together and spend a week on the parts that have nothing to do with expenses - connection pooling, session management, deployment scripts. Most of that work is plumbing every business app needs and nobody's users ever see.

Enterprise low-code platforms exist to delete that plumbing. OutSystems and Mendix are the two best-known. Instead of typing the plumbing into existence, you describe your app in a visual model, and the platform generates the running application - database tables, screens, server logic, and the connective tissue - for you.

## Model-driven development, in plain terms

"Model-driven" means the thing you build is a diagram of intent, not lines of text. You draw an entity called `Invoice` with fields like `amount` and `due_date`, and the platform creates the database table behind it. You drag a screen onto a canvas, drop your invoice data onto it, and you have a working list with paging and sorting. You draw your business logic as a flowchart - "if amount is over $5,000, route to the VP for approval, otherwise auto-approve" - with boxes and arrows instead of nested if-statements.

The platform keeps these models in sync. Add a field to your `Invoice` entity and the database migration, the form input, and the data layer all update together. That tight coupling is the whole point: one change, propagated everywhere, with the platform handling the wiring you would normally get wrong by hand.

```text
Traditional build               Low-code build
-----------------               --------------
write DB schema           -->   draw an entity
write API endpoints       -->   (generated for you)
build login + sessions    -->   built in, toggle on
code each screen          -->   drag data onto a canvas
write if/else logic       -->   draw a logic flowchart
write deploy scripts      -->   one-click publish
```

This is not magic and it is not no-code in the strictest sense. The "low" in low-code means you still drop into actual code for the hard 10% - a tricky calculation, a custom widget, a weird integration. But the routine 90% is visual.

## Who buys this, and the two reasons why

The buyers are large organizations with a backlog of internal apps and not enough developers to clear it. Banks, insurers, logistics firms, hospital networks, government agencies. They are not building the next consumer app; they are building the hundred unglamorous tools that run a business - onboarding portals, inspection checklists, claims trackers, dealer dashboards.

They pay for two things:

**Speed.** A small team can ship a working business app in weeks instead of quarters because the plumbing is gone. When the backlog is two hundred apps deep, that multiplier is the entire pitch.

**Governance at scale.** This is the part that separates enterprise low-code from a weekend app builder, and it is often the real reason a CIO signs the check. The platform enforces who can deploy to production, keeps an audit trail of every change, manages environments (development, test, production) as first-class objects, handles single sign-on against the corporate directory, and bakes in security scanning. A regulated company cannot let a hundred shadow apps sprawl across random spreadsheets and Access databases. Low-code gives them a sanctioned, governed place for all of it - fast development that IT still controls.

That combination - speed plus control - is why these tools command enterprise prices and show up as hard requirements in job postings.

## OutSystems vs Mendix at a glance

They solve the same problem and look similar from across the room, but their personalities differ.

| | OutSystems | Mendix |
|---|---|---|
| Origin | Portugal, founded 2001 | Netherlands, founded 2005 (now owned by Siemens) |
| Build environment | Desktop tool (Service Studio) | Desktop + browser (Studio Pro and Studio) |
| Reputation | Polished, opinionated, strong UI tooling | Model-first, strong for collaborative business+IT teams |
| Collaboration angle | Developer-centric | Pushes "business analysts and developers in the same model" |
| Cloud | Mostly vendor-managed cloud | Cloud, plus more on-prem flexibility |
| Ownership | Independent (private) | Part of Siemens' industrial software stack |

Two practical differences worth knowing. Mendix leans harder into letting non-developers (business analysts) work in a simplified studio alongside professional developers in the deeper tool - useful if your bet is on business-IT collaboration. OutSystems is more of a developer's tool with a reputation for refined front-end tooling and a more guided, opinionated experience. Mendix being owned by Siemens means its roadmap is increasingly tied to industrial and IoT use cases; OutSystems steers its own ship.

For most decisions, the choice between them matters far less than the choice of whether to adopt enterprise low-code at all. That second question - what you give up, and what it costs - is what the next two phases are really about. First, what building on one of these actually feels like.
