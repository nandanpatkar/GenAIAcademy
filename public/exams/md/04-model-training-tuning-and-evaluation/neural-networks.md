## Types of Neural Networks

### 1. Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN)

- **Definition**: The simplest type of artificial neural network where connections between units do not form cycles. Data flows in one direction—from input layer, through hidden layers (if any), to output layer.
- **Architecture**:
  - **Input layer**: Receives raw data (features).
  - **Hidden layer(s)**: One or more layers of neurons performing weighted sums and activations.
  - **Output layer**: Produces final prediction or classification.
- **Activation Functions**: Sigmoid, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), Tanh, Softmax (in output layer for multi-class problems).
- **Training**: Backpropagation with gradient descent (or variants like Adam, RMSProp).
- **Use Cases**:
  - Regression problems (predict continuous values).
  - Simple classification (binary or multiclass).
- **Pros & Cons**:
  - **Pros**: Straightforward, fast to train for small problems.
  - **Cons**: Cannot capture spatial or temporal dependencies; prone to overfitting if too deep or wide.

### 2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

- **Definition**: Neural networks designed to process grid-like data (e.g., images) by leveraging convolutional layers that learn spatial hierarchies of features.
- **Key Components**:
  - **Convolutional layers**: Learn local filters (kernels) that detect edges, textures, shapes.
  - **Pooling layers**: Downsample feature maps (max pooling, average pooling) to reduce spatial dimensions.
  - **Fully connected layers**: At the end, to combine extracted features for classification or regression.
- **Typical Architecture for Image Classification**:
  1. Input image (e.g., 224×224×3)
  2. Convolution + ReLU → feature maps
  3. Pooling → reduced maps
  4. Repeat conv + pool blocks
  5. Flatten → vector
  6. Fully connected layers → logits
  7. Softmax → class probabilities
- **Use Case Example**: Detecting a stop sign in an image. The network learns to identify edges, corners, and eventually the specific shape and color patterns of stop signs.
- **Pros & Cons**:
  - **Pros**: Excellent for vision tasks; spatial parameter sharing reduces number of parameters.
  - **Cons**: Requires large amounts of labeled data; computationally intensive.

### 3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

- **Definition**: Networks with loops in their connections, allowing information to persist. Designed to process sequential data by maintaining a hidden state that captures context.
- **Architecture**:
  - **Recurrent layer**: At each time step _t_, processes input _xₜ_ and previous hidden state _hₜ₋₁_ to produce new hidden state _hₜ_.
  - **Output layer**: Can produce output at each time step or only at the end.
- **Mathematical Step**:
  \[h*t = \phi(W*{xh}x*t + W*{hh}h*{t-1} + b_h)\]
  \[y_t = W*{hy}h_t + b_y\]
  where \(\phi\) is activation (tanh or ReLU).
- **Use Cases**:
  - Time series prediction (stock prices, weather forecasting).
  - Language modeling, next-word prediction.
  - Machine translation (input and output sequences).
- **Limitations**:
  - Vanishing/exploding gradients for long sequences.

### 4. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

- **Definition**: A special kind of RNN capable of learning long-range dependencies using gated cells to control information flow.
- **Cell Components**:
  - **Forget gate** \(f_t\): Decides which information to discard from cell state.
  - **Input gate** \(i_t\): Decides which new information to add.
  - **Candidate layer** \(\tilde{C}\_t\): Creates new candidate values.
  - **Cell state** \(C_t\): Accumulates long-term memory.
  - **Output gate** \(o_t\): Decides what to output from cell state.
- **Equations**:
  \[
  f*t = \sigma(W_f\cdot[x_t,h*{t-1}] + b*f)\\
  i_t = \sigma(W_i\cdot[x_t,h*{t-1}] + b*i)\\
  \tilde{C}\_t = \tanh(W_C\cdot[x_t,h*{t-1}] + b*C)\\
  C_t = f_t \* C*{t-1} + i*t \* \tilde{C}\_t\\
  o_t = \sigma(W_o\cdot[x_t,h*{t-1}] + b_o)\\
  h_t = o_t \* \tanh(C_t)
  \]
- **Use Cases**:
  - Language translation and sequence-to-sequence tasks.
  - Speech recognition.
  - Time series forecasting with long dependencies.

### 5. Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)

- **Definition**: A streamlined version of LSTM that combines forget and input gates into a single update gate, with fewer parameters.
- **Cell Components**:
  - **Update gate** \(z_t\): Controls how much of previous state to keep.
  - **Reset gate** \(r_t\): Controls how to combine new input with previous memory.
- **Equations**:
  \[
  z*t = \sigma(W_z\cdot[x_t,h*{t-1}] + b*z)\\
  r_t = \sigma(W_r\cdot[x_t,h*{t-1}] + b*r)\\
  \tilde{h}\_t = \tanh(W_h\cdot[x_t, r_t \* h*{t-1}] + b*h)\\
  h_t = (1 - z_t) \* h*{t-1} + z_t \* \tilde{h}\_t
  \]
- **Use Cases**:
  - Similar to LSTM but when computational efficiency and fewer parameters are desired.
  - Real-time sequence processing on resource-constrained devices.
