## AWS Services & Features

- **EBS Volume Types**:
  - **General Purpose SSD (gp3, gp2)**: Balanced price and performance for most workloads, including ML training and inference.
  - **Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2, io1)**: High-performance, low-latency storage for I/O-intensive applications like large-scale ML training or databases.
  - **Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)**: Cost-effective for large, sequential workloads (e.g., big data, log processing).
  - **Cold HDD (sc1)**: Lowest cost, suitable for infrequently accessed data.
- **Snapshots**: Point-in-time backups of EBS volumes, stored in Amazon S3. Snapshots enable disaster recovery, data migration, and reproducibility in ML workflows.
- **Encryption**: EBS supports encryption at rest and in transit, using AWS Key Management Service (KMS).
- **Integration**: EBS integrates with EC2, AWS Backup, and can be used as storage for custom ML environments (e.g., SageMaker training on EC2).

## Practical Application

- **ML Training Data Storage**: Store large datasets on EBS volumes attached to EC2 or SageMaker training instances for high-throughput access.
- **Reproducibility**: Use EBS snapshots to capture the state of data and code, enabling consistent, repeatable ML experiments.
- **Performance Tuning**: Select appropriate EBS volume types (e.g., io2 for high IOPS) based on ML workload requirements.
- **Example Architecture**:
  - EC2 instance with attached EBS volumes for storing training data, model artifacts, and logs.
  - Snapshots used to back up data before/after training jobs.

## Challenges & Best Practices

- **Performance Optimization**:
  - Match EBS volume type to workload (e.g., use io2 for high IOPS needs).
  - Monitor and adjust volume size and IOPS as needed.
- **Cost Management**:
  - Delete unused volumes and snapshots to avoid unnecessary charges.
  - Use lower-cost volume types (st1, sc1) for infrequently accessed data.
- **Data Durability & Backup**:
  - Regularly create snapshots for backup and disaster recovery.
  - Automate snapshot management with AWS Backup or Lambda functions.
- **Security**:
  - Enable encryption for sensitive ML data.
  - Use IAM policies to control access to EBS resources.
