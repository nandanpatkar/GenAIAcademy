## Practical “starter recipes”

### 1) Balanced default RAG (filters + decent RAM)

- **Engine:** lucene (or faiss)
- **Method:** HNSW
- **Vectors:** float (or mild quantization)
- **Tuning:** moderate `ef_search` (raise until recall is good enough)

### 2) Big corpus, RAM constrained

- **Engine:** faiss
- **Method:** IVF (or HNSW + compression)
- **Mode:** `on_disk` and/or binary quantization
- **Tuning:** `nprobe` (IVF) + oversample/rescore

### 3) Tiny filtered subsets (strong metadata filters)

- **Mode:** exact brute force after a filter
- **Note:** Only works if the filtered candidate pool stays small
