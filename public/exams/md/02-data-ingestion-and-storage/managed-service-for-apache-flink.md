## When To Use

- Use for long-running streaming ETL and real-time analytics on Kinesis/MSK streams.
- Use Flink Studio for interactive stream queries and notebook-style exploration.
- Use when stateful processing, windows, checkpoints, snapshots, or stream joins matter.

## Core Concepts

- Supports Java, Scala, Python, and SQL depending on the Flink API.
- Provides managed provisioning, parallel computation, automatic scaling, AZ failover, checkpoints, and snapshots.
- This is the current name for the former Kinesis Data Analytics service family.

## AWS Services And Features

- Amazon Managed Service for Apache Flink
- Managed Service for Apache Flink Studio
- Kinesis Data Streams
- Amazon MSK

## Implementation Patterns

- Kinesis stream -> Flink application -> enriched stream, S3 sink, OpenSearch, or dashboard.
- Studio notebook -> interactive SQL/Python/Scala analysis -> optionally promote to a long-running application.

## Tradeoffs And Pitfalls

- Kinesis Data Analytics for SQL is in full shutdown; use Managed Service for Apache Flink or Flink Studio.
- Use Data Firehose for delivery/transformation when full stateful stream processing is unnecessary.
- DataStream API gives more control than SQL/Table API but requires more engineering ownership.

## Decision Triggers

- Stateful streaming ETL or real-time windows point to Flink.
- Ad hoc streaming SQL notebook points to Flink Studio.
- Simple delivery to S3/OpenSearch/Redshift points to Data Firehose.
