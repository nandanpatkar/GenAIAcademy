## 1. Overview

**SQL databases** (also known as relational databases) are structured systems that store data in tables with predefined schemas. They use Structured Query Language (SQL) for defining, manipulating, and querying data. SQL databases are ideal for applications requiring complex queries, transactional consistency, and strong data integrity.

**Key Features of SQL Databases:**

- **Structured Schema:** Data is organized into tables with defined columns and data types.
- **ACID Compliance:** Support for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability, ensuring reliable transactions.
- **Powerful Querying:** SQL enables complex joins, aggregations, and analytical queries.
- **Data Integrity:** Enforces constraints, relationships, and referential integrity between tables.

**Relevance in AWS Machine Learning Workflows:**

- **Data Preparation:** Many ML workflows start with structured data stored in SQL databases, making them a common source for feature engineering and model training.
- **Transactional Data:** Applications that generate transactional data (e.g., e-commerce, finance) often use SQL databases as their primary data store.
- **Integration:** SQL databases integrate with AWS analytics and ML services (e.g., SageMaker, Glue, Redshift) for seamless data pipelines.

- **Key Features:**
  - Automated backups, patching, and scaling.
  - High availability with Multi-AZ deployments.
  - Read replicas for scaling read workloads.
- **Use Cases:** OLTP applications, web/mobile backends, ERP/CRM systems.
- **Why Essential:** Simplifies database management, allowing teams to focus on application development.

### Amazon Aurora

- **Type:** MySQL- and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database.
- **Key Features:**
  - Up to 5x performance of standard MySQL and 3x of PostgreSQL.
  - Fault-tolerant, self-healing storage.
  - Serverless and Global Database options.
- **Use Cases:** High-performance OLTP, SaaS applications, global apps.
- **Why Essential:** Combines the performance and availability of commercial databases with the cost-effectiveness of open source.

### Amazon Redshift
