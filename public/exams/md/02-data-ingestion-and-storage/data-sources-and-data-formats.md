## Common Data Sources

When building ETL/ELT pipelines, your raw data may originate from many different places. Understanding each source's characteristics helps you choose the right connector, handle authentication, and ensure data quality.

| Source Type                     | Interface / Protocol                                                         | Characteristics & Considerations                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Relational Databases**        | **JDBC** (Java Database Connectivity); **ODBC** (Open Database Connectivity) | JDBC is Java‑based, platform‑independent, but requires Java client libraries; ODBC is language‑agnostic but driver‑dependent per platform; Typical use: batch extracts from Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL. |
| **SaaS & Web Services**         | **RESTful APIs**, **SOAP**                                                   | HTTP/HTTPS endpoints returning JSON, XML, or CSV payloads; Must manage rate limits, auth (API keys, OAuth), pagination.                                                                                            |
| **Flat Files & Object Storage** | Local/Network file systems, Amazon S3, HDFS                                  | Plain‑text logs (e.g., Apache, application logs) or exported CSVs; Files arrive via SFTP, manual drop, or event notifications (S3 PUT events).                                                                     |
| **Streaming Platforms**         | **Apache Kafka** / **MSK**, **Amazon Kinesis Data Streams**                  | High‑throughput, low‑latency event streams; Consumers use partition/offset bookmarks; must handle ordering, backpressure.                                                                                          |
| **NoSQL & Document Stores**     | Native drivers (e.g., MongoDB, DynamoDB)                                     | Semi‑structured JSON documents or key/value pairs; Often used for clickstream, user profiles, session data.                                                                                                        |

## Common Data Formats

| Format       | Description                                                                                            | Pros                                                                           | Cons                                                                             | Common Systems                          | Best Use Cases                                                                                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

### Usage Patterns & Tips

1. **When to use JDBC vs. ODBC**

   - If your ETL code is Java‑native, JDBC avoids extra layers.
   - For Python, .NET or other languages, ODBC (via appropriate drivers) or language‑specific connectors (e.g., psycopg2 for PostgreSQL) may be more convenient.

2. **Choosing file formats**

   - **Small, ad‑hoc datasets** → CSV for its simplicity.
   - **Config files or lightweight data exchange** → JSON for readability and nested structures.
   - **High‑volume, schema‑evolving streams** → Avro to co‑locate schema with data.
   - **Analytical queries over large tables** → Parquet for column‑pruning and compression.

3. **Combining sources & formats**
   - A typical pipeline might extract JSON payloads from REST APIs, store them raw in S3, then transform and write out partitioned Parquet tables for fast, cost‑effective analytics via Athena or Redshift Spectrum.
