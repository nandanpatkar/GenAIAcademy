**Amazon Athena** is a fully serverless, interactive query service that lets you analyze data directly in S3 using standard SQL. Under the hood, Athena uses the open‑source Presto engine. There is no infrastructure to manage—you simply point Athena at your data, define schemas in the AWS Glue Data Catalog (or in Athena’s own catalog), and start querying. You pay per query ($5 per terabyte scanned, with discounts for partitioning and columnar formats).

| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Service Type**     | Extension of a provisioned Redshift cluster                                                                          | Fully serverless, standalone query service                           |
| **Query Engine**     | Redshift’s MPP engine + Spectrum read nodes                                                                          | Presto                                                               |
| **Data Integration** | Queries combine internal Redshift tables + S3 external                                                               | Queries only against S3 external data                                |
| **Performance**      | Can push joins/aggregations into Redshift clusters; good for mixed workloads with hot data in cluster and cold in S3 | Single‑stage Presto processing; strong for ad hoc, pure S3 analytics |
| **Concurrency**      | Limited by cluster size and concurrency scaling                                                                      | Virtually unlimited concurrent queries (subject to AWS limits)       |
| **Pricing**          | Pay for Redshift cluster (instance hours) + $0.01 per TB scanned by Spectrum                                         | $5 per TB scanned; no cluster costs                                  |
| **Use Cases**        | Complex analytics joining hot (cluster) + cold (S3) data; ETL off‑cluster                                            | Ad hoc analytics, exploratory queries over S3 data                   |
| **Administration**   | Must manage Redshift cluster (resize, tuning)                                                                        | No infrastructure to manage                                          |

### When to Choose Redshift Spectrum

- **Mixed Workloads:** You have hot (“frequently accessed”) data in Redshift and cold (“infrequently accessed”) data in S3, and you want to query both in a single SQL statement.
- **Complex Analytics:** You need advanced Redshift features (e.g. materialized views, sophisticated UDFs) plus the ability to offload large, seldom‑used datasets to S3.
- **Predictable Performance:** When you already run a Redshift cluster and want consistent SLAs for complex joins and BI dashboards.

### When to Choose Athena

- **Serverless Simplicity:** You prefer zero cluster management and auto‑scaling for fully ad hoc queries.
- **Cost‑Effective Exploratory Analysis:** You query data intermittently and only pay for the data scanned.
- **High Concurrency:** You need many users or applications querying the same S3 datasets simultaneously.

---

#### Summary

- **Redshift Spectrum** augments a provisioned Redshift cluster by transparently querying external tables in S3, ideal for blending hot and cold data and leveraging Redshift’s MPP engine and BI integrations.
- **Athena** is a standalone, serverless query service powered by Presto, optimized for ad hoc, pay‑per‑use analytics directly on S3. Choose based on your performance needs, workload patterns, and management preferences.
