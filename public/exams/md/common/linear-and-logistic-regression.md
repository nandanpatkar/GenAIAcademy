## Overview of Linear Regression

Linear regression estimates a linear predictor function of the form  
\[
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \dots + \beta_p x_p
\]  
where \(y\) is continuous and \(x_i\) are input features  ([Linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Linear vs. Logistic Regression](https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/articles/linear-regression-vs-logistic-regression/)). Coefficients \(\beta\) are found by minimizing the mean squared error between predictions and true values using ordinary least squares (OLS)  ([Linear vs. Logistic Regression](https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/articles/linear-regression-vs-logistic-regression/)). The resulting model produces continuous, unbounded outputs that can take any real value  ([Linear vs. Logistic Regression](https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/articles/linear-regression-vs-logistic-regression/)). Common use cases include forecasting and trend analysis in finance, marketing, and the physical sciences, as well as explanatory modeling to quantify relationships between variables  ([Linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

## Overview of Logistic Regression

Logistic regression models the log-odds of the probability of a binary outcome as a linear function of input features and applies the logistic function  
\[
\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}
\]  
to map the result to \([0,1]\)  ([Logistic regression - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). The model’s form can be written as  
\[
P(y=1 \mid \mathbf{x}) = \sigma\bigl(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \dots + \beta_p x_p\bigr).
\]  
Parameters are estimated via maximum likelihood estimation, iteratively optimizing the log-likelihood of observing the given class labels  ([Linear vs. Logistic Regression](https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/articles/linear-regression-vs-logistic-regression/)). The output is a probability score, which can be thresholded (commonly at 0.5) to assign class labels  ([Logistic regression - Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). Logistic regression is widely applied in spam detection, credit scoring, and medical diagnosis for its probabilistic interpretation and ease of implementation  ([Logistic regression - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [What is Logistic Regression Used for? - H2O.ai](https://h2o.ai/wiki/logistic-regression/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
