## Amazon Bedrock Guardrails

Amazon Bedrock Guardrails is AWS’s “policy layer” you attach to model interactions to reduce unsafe outputs, block certain topics, scrub sensitive data, and (optionally) check whether responses are grounded in a reference source. The key idea is consistency: you define guardrails once, then apply them across multiple foundation models and apps so your safety and privacy behavior does not depend on which model you picked. ([AWS Documentation][1])

You can use guardrails in two main ways:

- **Inline with inference**: specify a guardrail ID and version when calling Bedrock inference APIs (for example InvokeModel, Converse, streaming variants). ([AWS Documentation][2])
- **Standalone evaluation**: call **ApplyGuardrail** to assess text without invoking an FM at all. This is handy for pre-moderation, post-moderation, or moderating text produced outside Bedrock. ([AWS Documentation][3])

## What a guardrail is made of

A guardrail is a bundle of policies you can mix and match (you do not need to enable everything). AWS describes these as a combination of multiple policies applied to prompts and responses, including content filters, denied topics, sensitive information filters, word filters, image filters, plus contextual grounding checks. ([AWS Documentation][4])

### 1) Content filters (harmful categories)

Content filters detect and filter harmful content in **prompts and/or responses**, with configurable strictness. You choose a **filter strength** (None / Low / Medium / High) per category and can set different strictness for input vs output. ([AWS Documentation][5])

Guardrails content filtering also extends beyond plain text:

- **Multimodal** filtering can cover both text and images, with categories like hate, insults, sexual, violence, misconduct, and prompt attacks. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][6])

### 2) Prompt attacks filter (prompt injection and jailbreaks)

Guardrails can detect **prompt attacks** (including jailbreak-style attempts to bypass safety and prompt-injection attempts to override developer instructions). Depending on configuration, you can set it to **Block** or **Detect (no action)**. ([AWS Documentation][7])

For multimodal prompt-attack detection, AWS notes you may need **input tagging** for the prompt-attack filter to be applied (important detail people often miss when nothing seems to trigger). ([AWS Documentation][8])

### 3) Denied topics (topic-level blocking)

Denied topics are custom “do not talk about X” policies. You define topics relevant to your application domain (for example, “illegal investment advice” for a banking assistant). AWS documentation notes you can add up to **30 denied topics** to a guardrail. ([AWS Documentation][9])

This is different from content filters:

- Content filters are general safety categories.
- Denied topics are **your** business or compliance boundaries.

### 4) Sensitive information filters (PII and custom patterns)

Sensitive info policies detect and handle sensitive information, including PII. You can configure handling (commonly redact/mask, sometimes block) and also define custom detection using regex-style patterns. ([AWS Documentation][10])

Practical use cases:

- Redact phone numbers, emails, IDs from transcripts before storage
- Prevent leakage of secrets embedded in prompts or retrieved context

### 5) Word filters

Word filters are the blunt instrument: block or flag specific words/phrases you never want to see in prompts or responses. They are especially useful for organization-specific forbidden terms, product codenames, or profanity lists, and they complement broader classifiers. (Word filters are part of how AWS summarizes guardrails’ policy bundle.) ([AWS Documentation][4])

### 6) Contextual grounding check (hallucination filtering)

Grounding checks help detect and filter hallucinations when you provide:

- a **reference source** (the “ground truth” text), and
- a **user query**, alongside the model response

AWS explicitly calls out supported use cases like summarization, paraphrasing, and question answering, and notes that conversational chatbot use cases are not supported for this check. ([AWS Documentation][11])

This is especially valuable in RAG pipelines where you want to enforce “answer only from the provided documents.”

---

## Safeguard tiers (and why you should care)

Guardrails supports **safeguard tiers** for certain policies, with different performance characteristics and language support. ([AWS Documentation][12])

AWS introduced an improved **Standard tier** for content filters and denied topics that focuses on more robust detection across variations and stronger defense including prompt attacks, plus broader language support. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][13])

Also notable: AWS announced expanded guardrails support for **coding use cases**, where filters can detect harmful content and PII inside code elements like comments, identifiers, and string literals (Standard tier). ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][14])

Takeaway: tiers matter if you are multilingual, doing code generation, or facing real prompt-injection pressure.

---

## Applying guardrails during inference (core mechanics)

When you invoke a model through Bedrock Runtime APIs, you attach:

- `guardrailIdentifier`
- `guardrailVersion`

AWS also documents a best-practice enforcement move: you can require a specific guardrail via IAM using the `bedrock:GuardrailIdentifier` condition key, denying inference calls that omit it. This is how you prevent “oops, somebody shipped without guardrails.” ([AWS Documentation][2])

### Minimal example (Boto3 InvokeModel)

```python
import json
import boto3

brt = boto3.client("bedrock-runtime", region_name="us-east-1")

body = {
  # model-specific payload here (example only)
  "inputText": "Summarize this customer call transcript: ...",
}

resp = brt.invoke_model(
    modelId="amazon.nova-lite-v1:0",
    body=json.dumps(body),
    guardrailIdentifier="gr-abc123456789",
    guardrailVersion="1",
)

result = json.loads(resp["body"].read())
print(result)
```

API details for InvokeModel are in the Bedrock Runtime reference. ([AWS Documentation][15])

### Standalone example (ApplyGuardrail)

Use this when you want to moderate text without calling a model.

```python
import boto3

brt = boto3.client("bedrock-runtime", region_name="us-east-1")

resp = brt.apply_guardrail(
    guardrailIdentifier="gr-abc123456789",
    guardrailVersion="1",
    source="INPUT",         # or OUTPUT depending on your flow
    content=[{"text": {"text": "User message here"}}],
)
print(resp)
```

ApplyGuardrail is a first-class API in Bedrock Runtime. ([AWS Documentation][16])

## Operational best practices (what actually survives production)

### Treat guardrails like code: version, test, roll out

Guardrails have versions and you can view version details in the console. Use versioning to do safe rollouts (dev → staging → prod) and to quickly revert if you over-block legitimate user flows. ([AWS Documentation][17])

A practical workflow:

- Version N: conservative policy for initial launch
- Version N+1: tighten prompt attack filters, refine denied topics, add PII patterns
- A/B test false positives in staging using recorded traffic + ApplyGuardrail

### Use IAM to make “no guardrails” impossible

If you operate multiple teams or services, enforce guardrail usage at the IAM layer with `bedrock:GuardrailIdentifier`. This prevents bypass via “direct model invocation” services. ([AWS Documentation][2])

### Layer defenses: guardrails + app logic

Guardrails are not a full security boundary. For example:

- Use input validation (length limits, allowed tools, allowlists)
- Use retrieval isolation (only pass necessary context)
- Use separate “system” instructions that users cannot overwrite
  Guardrails helps, but your app design is where most exploit resistance is won.

### Log decisions and reasons

For audits and debugging, store:

- which guardrail version fired
- which policy triggered (topic, PII, prompt attack, content category)
- what action happened (block vs redact)
  This turns “the model refused” from a mystery into an explainable event.

---

## Limits and gotchas you should plan for

- **Contextual grounding** requires a reference source and supports specific use cases; it is not a general-purpose “chatbot truth detector.” ([AWS Documentation][11])
- **Prompt attack detection** can depend on configuration details like input tagging in multimodal scenarios. ([AWS Documentation][8])
- **Coverage varies by Region/model and tier**. Always check the supported Regions/models page for your target deployment. ([AWS Documentation][18])
- **Language support is policy-specific** (not every policy supports every language equally). ([AWS Documentation][19])

---

## Cost and deployment notes

Guardrails is part of Bedrock’s overall offering and pricing is described under Amazon Bedrock pricing, but your effective cost footprint depends on how often you evaluate prompts and responses (and whether you also do standalone ApplyGuardrail calls). ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][20])

---

## Mental model to keep you sane

Think of Guardrails as:

1. **A classifier and transformer layer** around inputs/outputs (block, redact, allow)
2. **A standard policy contract** across different models
3. **An enforceable control point** via IAM so safety is not optional

That contract is the real superpower: it lets you swap models without re-litigating safety every time. ([AWS Documentation][1])
