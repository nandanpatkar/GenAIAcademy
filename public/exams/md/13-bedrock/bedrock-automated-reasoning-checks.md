## 1) What it is

**Automated Reasoning checks** is a **Guardrails policy type** in Amazon Bedrock that uses **formal (logic-based) verification** to validate whether an LLM’s output is consistent with the rules you define for a domain. Instead of “best effort” filtering (keywords, classifiers, another LLM judging), it translates relevant parts of text into logic and then checks whether the claims can be proven true (or proven false) under your policy. ([AWS Documentation][1])

AWS positions it as a way to reduce hallucinations and improve trust for domains where “close enough” is not acceptable, like HR policy, regulated workflows, complex eligibility rules, and compliance explanations. ([AWS Documentation][1])

## 2) The core idea and mental model

Think of Automated Reasoning checks as a pipeline:

1. **You provide a domain rules source** (policy docs, manuals, guidelines).
2. Bedrock extracts a **formal policy**: variables + rules expressed in logic.
3. At runtime, it:

   - Identifies **premises** (context and conditions) and **claims** (statements being asserted) in the input and model output.
   - Translates those into logic (with a confidence score).
   - Uses a reasoning engine to decide if the claims are logically supported or contradicted by your policy rules. ([AWS Documentation][2])

Bedrock calls the formalized artifact an **Automated Reasoning policy**. It includes a schema (variables and types) plus the extracted rules that operate on them. ([AWS Documentation][3])

## 3) Where it sits inside Guardrails

Guardrails evaluates both **user input** and the **model response**, and can intervene by blocking or masking content depending on configuration. It evaluates policies in parallel for latency, and it can run with Bedrock Agents and Knowledge Bases. ([AWS Documentation][4])

Automated Reasoning checks is one component among others, such as:

- **Contextual grounding checks** (grounded in source + relevant to query)
- **Topic policies**
- **Content filters** ([AWS Documentation][5])

Important nuance: Automated Reasoning checks is about **logical validity against your rules**, not “is the answer on-topic” or “is it grounded in a retrieved doc”. Off-topic detection is explicitly not its job. ([AWS Documentation][1])

## 4) Workflow end to end

AWS describes a 4-step workflow:

1. Upload a rules source document
2. Review the extracted policy (concepts, variables, rules)
3. Test and refine
4. Deploy for runtime validation ([AWS Documentation][6])

### 4.1 Create an Automated Reasoning policy

You create a policy resource, optionally with a customer managed KMS key. Policies are encrypted with AWS KMS. ([AWS Documentation][3])

Then you run a **build workflow** to ingest and translate source content into formal logic. The docs list workflow types including `INGEST_CONTENT`, `REFINE_POLICY`, and `IMPORT_POLICY`. ([AWS Documentation][3])

### 4.2 Test it (this is where you earn correctness)

Bedrock strongly recommends test cases that include **valid and invalid scenarios**, so you can verify the policy catches incorrect outputs and accepts correct ones. ([AWS Documentation][7])

During testing, Automated Reasoning uses the question/answer plus your policy variables and their descriptions to translate natural language into formal logic. ([AWS Documentation][7])

### 4.3 Interpret test results (findings)

Test output is organized as **findings** representing extracted premises and claims, each with:

- A **result** (VALID, INVALID, etc)
- A **confidence score** (0.0 to 1.0) for the translation
- **Assignments** (variable bindings that make the proof work)
- The relevant **rules** from your policy that supported the decision ([AWS Documentation][2])

### 4.4 Refine when tests fail

If a test fails unexpectedly, you use **annotations** to repair and refine the policy. The docs call out fixes like:

- Correct wrong rules
- Add missing variables
- Improve variable descriptions
- Resolve translation ambiguities ([AWS Documentation][8])

## 5) The meaning of results (this is the “logic verdict” vocabulary)

When Automated Reasoning checks evaluates a piece of content, it can produce results like: ([AWS Documentation][2])

- **VALID**: Claims are logically consistent with policy rules and can be proven true. (But only for the portions that were actually captured via policy variables.) ([AWS Documentation][2])
- **INVALID**: Claims contradict policy rules and can be proven false under the policy. ([AWS Documentation][2])
- **SATISFIABLE**: Not contradicted, consistent with at least one interpretation, but may be incomplete relative to all relevant constraints. ([AWS Documentation][2])
- **IMPOSSIBLE**: The policy or premises are inconsistent, so no meaningful conclusion can be drawn. ([AWS Documentation][2])
- **TRANSLATION_AMBIGUOUS**: The system detected ambiguity in mapping natural language to logic, so it stops rather than risk an unsound verdict. ([AWS Documentation][2])
- **TOO_COMPLEX**: The reasoning task exceeds processing limits. ([AWS Documentation][2])
- **NO_TRANSLATIONS**: Nothing (or not enough) translated into logic, often because content is out of scope for the policy variables. ([AWS Documentation][2])

Also note: the docs explicitly say charges can apply regardless of result types (including cases like ambiguous translation). ([AWS Documentation][1])

## 6) Deployment and runtime integration

### 6.1 Save a version for production use

Policies have a mutable draft and you can create an immutable version to deploy. ([AWS Documentation][9])

### 6.2 Attach policy to a Guardrail

When creating or updating a guardrail, you enable Automated Reasoning checks by setting an `automatedReasoningConfig` and referencing the **policy ARN** you want to use. ([AWS Documentation][10])

Example sketch:

```json
{
  "automatedReasoningConfig": {
    "policyArn": "arn:aws:bedrock:REGION:ACCOUNT:automated-reasoning-policy/POLICY_ID:VERSION"
  }
}
```

### 6.3 How Guardrails processes an inference call

At inference time, Guardrails evaluates input first; if blocked, the model inference is discarded. If input passes, it runs the model, then evaluates the model response and may override it if there is a violation. ([AWS Documentation][4])

### 6.4 What you get back (shape of results)

In Bedrock Runtime responses, automated reasoning assessment shows up as an object containing a list of **findings**. Boto3 documents this as `automatedReasoningPolicy` with `findings`. ([Boto3][11])

## 7) Limitations and gotchas (very important for real systems)

From the docs, key limitations include: ([AWS Documentation][1])

- **Not a prompt injection defense**. It validates exactly what it receives. Combine with content filters and other controls for injection and safety. ([AWS Documentation][1])
- **Not an off-topic detector**. It ignores content irrelevant to the policy and cannot tell you the answer is off-topic. Use topic policies or other mechanisms. ([AWS Documentation][1])
- **English (US) only** (at least as documented right now). ([AWS Documentation][6])
- **No streaming API support** for Automated Reasoning checks. ([AWS Documentation][6])
- **Document constraints and quality matter**: better structured, unambiguous rules extract more cleanly. Docs also mention limits like file size and character count, and warn that complexity (nested conditions, contradictions) can reduce extraction quality. ([AWS Documentation][1])
- **Latency and complexity tradeoffs**: validation adds processing time; non-linear arithmetic constraints can time out or return TOO_COMPLEX. ([AWS Documentation][1])
- **Scope discipline**: each policy should focus on a specific domain rather than mixing unrelated topics. ([AWS Documentation][1])

## 8) Regions and release status

AWS announced general availability on **August 6, 2025**, and lists supported regions including US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), US East (Ohio), and several EU regions (Frankfurt, Ireland, Paris). ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][12])

## 9) Pricing model (how you pay)

Guardrails pricing is policy-based: you are charged for evaluation of the policies configured in your guardrail, and the billing differs depending on whether the prompt or response is blocked (for example, if input is blocked, you do not pay for model inference). ([AWS Documentation][4])

For Automated Reasoning checks specifically, the docs state it is charged based on number of validation requests processed, and you are charged per request regardless of result (VALID, INVALID, TRANSLATION_AMBIGUOUS, etc). ([AWS Documentation][1])

## 10) Best practices that actually help

### Policy and source document best practices

- Use **well-structured, explicit rules** (avoid ambiguous pronouns, undefined terms, contradictory clauses). The quality of extraction depends on it. ([AWS Documentation][1])
- Keep each policy focused on a single **domain boundary** (HR, mortgage eligibility, internal SOPs). ([AWS Documentation][1])
- Invest in **variable naming and descriptions**, since translation uses them to map natural language to formal logic. ([AWS Documentation][7])

### Testing strategy best practices

- Write tests for **both correct and incorrect** answers so you validate rejection behavior, not just acceptance. ([AWS Documentation][7])
- Use the **confidence threshold** as a tuning knob: higher thresholds favor only very confident translations, which can reduce risky verdicts but may increase “ambiguous” outcomes. ([AWS Documentation][2])

### Refinement strategy

- Treat failures as data. Use **annotations** to fix missing variables, wrong rules, or ambiguous translations. ([AWS Documentation][8])
- If you hit TRANSLATION_AMBIGUOUS often, rewrite prompts and rules to be more explicit and reduce lexical collisions (terms that could map to multiple variables). ([AWS Documentation][8])

## 11) When to use Automated Reasoning vs contextual grounding

A practical rule of thumb:

- Use **Contextual grounding checks** when correctness depends on “did you stick to this source text and answer the asked question?”
- Use **Automated Reasoning checks** when correctness depends on “did you follow these rules, constraints, and eligibility logic?”

They are complementary and often used together in higher-stakes systems. ([AWS Documentation][5])

## 12) A useful agent pattern (how people wire it in)

A common pattern is:

1. Generate answer
2. Run Guardrails with Automated Reasoning checks
3. If result is INVALID, SATISFIABLE (incomplete), or TRANSLATION_AMBIGUOUS:

   - Feed back the finding summary to the model
   - Ask it to revise with missing constraints or clarify assumptions

4. Return final answer only when VALID (or when your product policy allows SATISFIABLE)

This “generate then verify then revise” loop is exactly where logic-based checks shine, because the feedback can be specific and auditable. ([AWS Documentation][2])

If you want, I can turn these notes into a Bedrock implementation template (Guardrail config + minimal policy build/test/deploy workflow), but the key conceptual pieces above are the ones that tend to show up on real systems and in exam questions.
