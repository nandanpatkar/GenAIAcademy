## Overview
- Custom Model Import lets you bring **customized open‑source foundation models** into Bedrock and use them via the same Bedrock inference APIs. 
- It preserves prior investments in fine‑tuning or continued pre‑training done outside Bedrock (for example in SageMaker). 
- Imported models can use Bedrock features like Guardrails, Knowledge Bases, and Agents. 

## Supported Customization Patterns
- **Fine‑tuned or continued pre‑training** on a base model (weights updated). 
- **Domain adaptation** for specific verticals or languages. 
- **Pretrained from scratch** with a custom model configuration. 

## Model and Region Support
- Supported architectures include Mistral, Mixtral, Flan, Llama (2/3/3.1/3.2/3.3, Mllama), GPTBigCode, Qwen (2/2.5/2‑VL/2.5‑VL/3), and GPT‑OSS (region‑restricted). 
- Supported Regions include eu‑central‑1, us‑east‑1, us‑east‑2, us‑west‑2 (check docs for current list). 

## Requirements
- Model files must be in **Hugging Face weights format** (for example `.safetensors` + `config.json`). 
- Models are imported from **Amazon S3** or an **Amazon SageMaker model repo**. 

## Inference and Limitations
- Imported models can be invoked via `InvokeModel` or streaming variants. 
- Batch inference and CloudFormation are not supported for imported models. 

## Workflow (High Level)
1. Prepare model weights and config in HF format.
2. Upload to S3 or point to a SageMaker model repo.
3. Create IAM role for Bedrock import job.
4. Submit `CreateModelImportJob` and monitor status.
5. Use the imported model ARN for inference.

## Best Practices
- Validate model performance in a sandbox before production use.
- Use Bedrock Evaluations to compare imported models against native FMs. 
- Apply Guardrails and monitoring to control risk.

## Exam Tips
- Custom Model Import = bring **customized open‑source models** into Bedrock.
- Requires Hugging Face weights format and S3/SageMaker hosting.
- Uses the same Bedrock inference APIs once imported.
