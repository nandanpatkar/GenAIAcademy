## Supervised Learning Models in AWS

Amazon SageMaker’s supervised algorithms train on labeled datasets to predict categorical or continuous outputs. They span general-purpose tabular methods, advanced feature engineering techniques, and specialized forecasting tools:

- **AutoGluon-Tabular**: An open-source AutoML framework that ensembles and stacks multiple models automatically for classification and regression tasks on tabular data ([Built-in Algorithms - Amazon SageMaker Python SDK - Read the Docs](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/algorithms/index.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

- **Object2Vec**: Learns dense embeddings of high-dimensional objects to produce features that accelerate and improve downstream supervised models ([Built-in algorithms and pretrained models in Amazon SageMaker - Amazon SageMaker AI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/algos.html)).
- **DeepAR**: Uses recurrent neural networks to generate probabilistic forecasts for scalar (one-dimensional) time-series data, valuable for demand planning and financial projections ([Amazon SageMaker Built-in Algorithms | AWS Machine Learning](https://k21academy.com/amazon-web-services/aws-ml/amazon-sagemaker-algorithms/)).
