MLA-C01 is preserved as a certification track, not the only purpose of the repo. Notes that still map to the AWS Certified Machine Learning Engineer - Associate exam keep the `MLA-C01` certification metadata and `mla-c01` tag so they remain useful for exam review.

## Certification Track: MLA-C01

The AWS Certified Machine Learning Engineer - Associate track remains useful for structured review. AWS describes the certification as validating technical ability to implement and operationalize ML workloads in production.

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Certification | AWS Certified Machine Learning Engineer - Associate |
| Exam code | MLA-C01 |
| Duration | 130 minutes |
| Question count | 65 questions |
| Passing score | 720 |
| Domain 1 | Data Preparation for Machine Learning, 28% |
| Domain 2 | ML Model Development, 26% |
| Domain 3 | Deployment and Orchestration of ML Workflows, 22% |
| Domain 4 | ML Solution Monitoring, Maintenance, and Security, 24% |

## Note Status Legend

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `reviewed` | Verified against current AWS docs and linked to applicable AWS services, concepts, or certification tracks |
| `draft` | Useful and normalized, but not yet promoted to the fully reviewed set |
| `stale` | Needs source refresh before relying on it for current implementation or certification study |
| `legacy` | AWS service or feature is no longer available to new customers, has no new releases, or is in shutdown/sunset status |
| `supplemental` | Useful background, emerging topic, or advanced material outside a specific certification's core testable scope |
| `out-of-scope` | Out of scope for a specific certification track; keep it if it is still useful for the broader AWS ML/AI knowledge base |

## How To Add Or Update A Note

1. Start from `NOTE_TEMPLATE.md`.
2. Use current AWS service names, such as Amazon SageMaker AI and Amazon Bedrock AgentCore.
3. Add frontmatter with `title`, `scope`, `status`, `domain`, `service`, `tags`, `aliases`, `last_verified`, and `source_type`.
4. Add `certifications` only when the note maps to a certification track, such as `MLA-C01`.
5. Include these sections: `Knowledge Relevance`, `When To Use`, `Core Concepts`, `AWS Services And Features`, `Implementation Patterns`, `Tradeoffs And Pitfalls`, `Decision Triggers`, `Related Notes`, and `Sources`.
6. Cite official AWS docs first. Use AWS blogs, whitepapers, release notes, or third-party sources only when AWS docs are insufficient.
7. Mark lifecycle caveats clearly. Do not delete legacy notes unless the repo owner asks for that cleanup.

## Validation Checks

Run the repo validator first:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_notes.py
```

Use strict section checks when intentionally migrating inherited notes to the full `NOTE_TEMPLATE.md` layout:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_notes.py --strict-sections
```

Useful focused spot checks:

```bash
rg --files-without-match '^# ' -g '*.md'
rg --files-without-match '^(## )?(Sources|References|Additional Resources)\b' -g '*.md'
rg -n '^exam: ' -g '*.md'
rg -n 'Elastic Inference|Training Compiler|Data Pipeline|Amazon Forecast|AWS AppConfig|AWS IoT Greengrass|AWS Shield|Amazon DataZone|Kinesis Data Analytics|Studio Classic|Edge Manager|CodeWhisperer|Glue Elastic Views' -g '*.md'
rg -n 'TODO|needs-verification|source_type: "needs-verification"' -g '*.md' --glob '!README.md' --glob '!PLAN_NOTES_IMPROVEMENT.md'
```
