## When To Use

- Use plain RAG when the main task is grounded Q&A over private or changing content.
- Use agentic RAG when the system must decide when to retrieve, query structured stores, call tools, ask follow-up questions, and synthesize across multiple steps.
- Use Bedrock Knowledge Bases for managed ingestion, retrieval, response generation, citations, multimodal retrieval, structured data query generation, and reranking.
- Use Bedrock Agents when RAG must be combined with action groups and managed orchestration.

## Core Concepts

- RAG improves relevance and accuracy by retrieving information from data sources before generation.
- Bedrock Knowledge Bases can return relevant sources, augment prompts, generate responses, provide citations, retrieve multimodal content, transform natural language into structured queries, and use reranking models.
- Agentic RAG adds planning: the model decides whether to retrieve, which source/tool to query, whether to rerank, and whether more context or an action is needed.
- Evaluation should check faithfulness, citation coverage, retrieval relevance, answer correctness, harmfulness, latency, and cost.

## Implementation Patterns

    Q["User task"] --> Plan["Agent plans next step"]
    Plan --> NeedRag{"Need private facts?"}
    NeedRag -->|Yes| Retrieve["Retrieve / rerank / cite"]
    NeedRag -->|No| Tool["Call action/tool if needed"]
    Retrieve --> Reason["Reason over evidence"]

```

- Managed Bedrock pattern: Bedrock Agent -> Knowledge Base -> action group -> final response.
- Custom pattern: custom agent -> Retrieve/RetrieveAndGenerate tool -> MCP/API tools -> evaluation/tracing.
- Structured-data pattern: natural language -> generated SQL/query over structured store -> evidence -> response.
- Multimodal pattern: image/text query -> multimodal embedding retrieval -> answer with visual/document evidence.

## Tradeoffs And Pitfalls

- Agentic RAG adds latency and cost because retrieval and tool calls may repeat across turns.
- Poor metadata and chunking still produce poor answers even with an agent.
- Agents can over-retrieve; constrain retrieval with task-specific instructions, metadata filters, and rerankers.
- Citations are not proof by themselves; evaluate whether cited chunks actually support claims.
- Do not use agentic RAG when deterministic search plus a short synthesis prompt is enough.

## Decision Triggers

- "Ground answers in private documents with citations" points to Bedrock Knowledge Bases.
- "Agent should use private docs and then submit/update a workflow" points to Bedrock Agents with a knowledge base and action group.
- "Need custom retrieval, reranking, and non-Bedrock tools" points to custom RAG plus AgentCore/MCP.
- "Structured store natural language query" points to Knowledge Bases structured data query generation or a custom SQL tool.
