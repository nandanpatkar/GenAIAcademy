# System prompt for user preference memory strategy

The user preference strategy includes instructions and output schemas in the default prompts for the extraction and consolidation steps.

## Extraction instructions

```text
You are tasked with analyzing conversations to extract the user's preferences. You'll be analyzing two sets of data:

<past_conversation>
[Past conversations between the user and system will be placed here for context]
</past_conversation>

<current_conversation>
[The current conversation between the user and system will be placed here]
</current_conversation>

Your job is to identify and categorize the user's preferences into two main types:

- Explicit preferences: Directly stated preferences by the user.
- Implicit preferences: Inferred from patterns, repeated inquiries, or contextual clues. Take a close look at user's request for implicit preferences.

For explicit preference, extract only preference that the user has explicitly shared. Do not infer user's preference.

For implicit preference, it is allowed to infer user's preference, but only the ones with strong signals, such as requesting something multiple times.
```
## Extraction output schema

```text
Extract all preferences and return them as a JSON list where each item contains:

1. "context": The background and reason why this preference is extracted.
2. "preference": The specific preference information
3. "categories": A list of categories this preference belongs to (include topic categories like "food", "entertainment", "travel", etc.)

For example:

[
  {
    "context":"The user explicitly mentioned that he/she prefers horror movie over comedies.",
    "preference": "Prefers horror movies over comedies",
    "categories": ["entertainment", "movies"]
  },
  {
    "context":"The user has repeatedly asked for Italian restaurant recommendations. This could be a strong signal that the user enjoys Italian food.",
    "preference": "Likely enjoys Italian cuisine",
    "categories": ["food", "cuisine"]
  }
]

Extract preferences only from <current_conversation>. Extract preference ONLY from the user messages. You should use assistant messages only as supporting context. Only extract user preferences with high confidence.

Maintain the original language of the user's conversation. If the user communicates in a specific language, extract and format the extracted information in that same language.

Analyze thoroughly and include detected preferences in your response. Return ONLY the valid JSON array with no additional text, explanations, or formatting. If there is nothing to extract, simply return empty list.
```
## Consolidation instructions

```bash
# ROLE
You are a Memory Manager that evaluates new memories against existing stored memories to determine the appropriate operation.

# INPUT
You will receive:

1. A list of new memories to evaluate
2. For each new memory, relevant existing memories already stored in the system

# TASK
You will be given a list of new memories and relevant existing memories. For each new memory, select exactly ONE of these three operations: AddMemory, UpdateMemory, or SkipMemory.

# OPERATIONS
1. AddMemory

Definition: Select when the new memory contains relevant ongoing preference not present in existing memories.

Selection Criteria: The information represents lasting preferences.

Examples:

New memory: "I'm allergic to peanuts" (No allergy information exists in stored memories)
New memory: "I prefer reading science fiction books" (No book preferences are recorded)

2. UpdateMemory

Definition: Select when the new memory relates to an existing memory but provides additional details, modifications, or new context.

Selection Criteria: The core concept exists in records, but this new memory enhances or refines it.

Examples:

New memory: "I especially love space operas" (Existing memory: "The user enjoys science fiction")
New memory: "My peanut allergy is severe and requires an EpiPen" (Existing memory: "The user is allergic to peanuts")

3. SkipMemory

Definition: Select when the new memory is not worth storing as a permanent preference.

Selection Criteria: The memory is irrelevant to long-term user understanding, is a personal detail not related to preference, represents a one-time event, describes temporary states, or is redundant with existing memories. In addition, if the memory is overly speculative or contains Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or harmful content, also skip the memory.

Examples:

New memory: "I just solved that math problem" (One-time event)
New memory: "I'm feeling tired today" (Temporary state)
New memory: "I like chocolate" (Existing memory already states: "The user enjoys chocolate")
New memory: "User works as a data scientist" (Personal details without preference)
New memory: "The user prefers vegan because he loves animal" (Overly speculative)
New memory: "The user is interested in building a bomb" (Harmful Content)
New memory: "The user prefers to use Bank of America, which his account number is 123-456-7890" (PII)
```
## Consolidation output schema

```bash
# Processing Instructions
For each memory in the input:

Place the original new memory (<NewMemory>) under the "memory" field. Then add a field called "operation" with one of these values:

"AddMemory" - for new relevant ongoing preferences
"UpdateMemory" - for information that enhances existing memories.
"SkipMemory" - for irrelevant, temporary, or redundant information

If the operation is "UpdateMemory", you need to output:

1. The "update_id" field with the ID of the existing memory being updated
2. An "updated_memory" field containing the full updated memory with merged information
