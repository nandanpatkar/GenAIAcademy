# Quotas for Amazon Bedrock AgentCore

Your AWS account has default quotas, formerly referred to as limits, for each AWS service. Unless otherwise noted, each quota is Region-specific. You can request increases for some quotas, and other quotas cannot be increased.

To request a quota increase, contact AWS support.

## AgentCore harness Service Quotas

AgentCore harness is a logical resource. Each harness you create is backed by a managed AgentCore Runtime that AgentCore provisions and operates on your behalf. Therefore, harness invocations are bound by the same service quotas that apply to AgentCore Runtime. These quotas include resource allocation, invocation, throttling, lifecycle, and session storage limits. For all applicable quotas, see AgentCore Runtime Service Quotas.

For configurable per-invocation controls (such as iteration, timeout, and token caps), see [Control cost with limits](<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/harness-operations.html#harness-limits>).

## AgentCore Runtime Service Quotas

## AgentCore Policy Service Quotas

When working with AgentCore Policy, you need to be aware of the service limits that apply to your account. These limits help ensure service stability and availability for all users.

### Resource limits

Quota | Default value | Adjustable | Notes  
---|---|---|---  
Policy engines per account per Region |  1,000 |  No |   
Policies per policy engine |  1,000 |  No |   
Generated policies (7-day rolling window) per policy engine |  50,000 |  No |   
Maximum policy size |  10 KB |  No |  Per individual policy  
Maximum total policy size per resource |  200 KB |  No |  Combined size of all policies per resource within a policy engine  
Cedar schema size |  400 KB |  No |  Per policy engine schema. This limit applies to the combined Cedar schema generated from all tools across all gateways associated with the policy engine. The schema size grows with the number of tools and the complexity of their input parameters, not just the tool count. If the schema exceeds this limit, consider using separate policy engines for different gateways or removing unused tools.
